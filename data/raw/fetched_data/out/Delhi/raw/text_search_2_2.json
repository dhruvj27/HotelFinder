Made a booking thru booking.com and had requested early check in well in advance over call and in writing from the property  which I totally understand was subject to availability. The standard time was 3.00 pm. but instead they gave an exhausted me the room with amenities mentioned in booking, close to 4 pm and that too as if they were doing a favor. Not mentioning names here but some of the front desk staff were appallingly haughty. A select few did extend genuine help. There were two things I specifically noticed about this place: I asked for two room keys (even if one of them deactivated) so I can keep the lights on for my child in room, in case I needed to step out for a wee bit, but they wouldnt give it as if I were asking for a treasure. Asked me to  'come back later' for it. Then I specifically noticed a bias in which they were sweet to foreigners and would happily let them check out with just a key drop but made us stand for long, for check out because they were 'checking our rooms' despite handing them card details and reporting minibar usage upfront. Why do not these people understand that business they get through people is what pays their salary irrespectively and that they are not there to judge or discriminate but render services and equally so? Upon complaining, they did give me extended check out hours, a complimentary cab to airport and a promise to upgrade to suite next time but will there be a next time now? Does this payment undo our distasteful  experience? Raddison is not a one night stand hotel but a dignified name.They should stop giving preferential treatment to customers of their choice and render services they have promised. Or maybe, just stop overcommitting.The management needs to train employees better in handling customer needs and esp do something about their biased behaviour. Customer's satisfaction and loyalty are not bought by hand outs but warm welcome, a comfortable stay and a stress free check out. So, I'm thoroughly disappointed.",

And it had all the basic amenities required.\nThe Cafe Pride and Oriental Spice restaurant are nice and spacious and serve delicious food. And offer  well spread and extensive buffet breakfast and dinner with numerous options to satisfy your taste buds. Though it gets a bit crowded during breakfast time and one must wait to get a table during the peak breakfast time.\nThe conference halls are spacious and are well equipped. However, the issue of mosquitoes is there in the conference hall though they did try to take care of the same by still this needs to be taken care of by the Hotel Management\nThe retail outlets of Aerocity are just round the corner of the exit of the Hotel and one can go there for shopping and also enjoy ambience and the food at the various outlets located in the vicinity.\nOverall it was a pleasant stay at the Pride Plaza Hotel and might stay again.",

The check-in process was smooth and the staff were courteous and professional throughout my stay. The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and offered all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. Housekeeping was timely and responsive, and the ambience of the hotel gave a warm and welcoming feel.\n\nThe location of the hotel is also quite convenient, especially for business travelers, with easy access to nearby commercial hubs and the airport. The facilities like the gym and spa were well-kept, and the common areas, including the lobby, had a premium feel.\n\nHowever, the one area that fell short of expectations was the food. The variety was limited, and the taste did not quite match the standard set by the rest of the hotel. Whether it was the breakfast buffet or the in-room dining options, the flavors lacked richness and authenticity. For a hotel of this standard, I had expected better culinary quality.\n\nThat said, I would still recommend Pride Plaza Hotel for its service, location, and hospitality. With some improvements in the food department, it could easily become a top choice for all kinds of travelers.",

Adarsh tried his best to keep us comfortable and provided us couple of things which were not part of the menu.\n\nFood - chaat, golgappa, were good, so was the paneer tikka though dahi kebab weren't great, coming to main course all the Indian breads were good though the daal tadka could have been better, lastly the sweet dish I.e. Gulab jamun and rasmalai were below average in terms of taste and perhaps the only saving grace was the vanilla ice cream.\n\nBottomline - it's not worth the price and hassle and ecxcept for the staff who were very courteous there are so many things which need to be worked upon before it could be considered as something worth spending",

We informed the receptionist very clearly that he wasn\u2019t checking out. But apparently, \u201ccommunication\u201d is just decorative at this hotel.\n\nWhile waiting for the valet, the receptionist decided to bless us with his presence\u2014five times\u2014to ask us to pay for a chocolate from the minibar. Yes, a chocolate. The room was fully paid for, mind you. But he looked at our bags and confidently concluded that we were sneaking away into the sunrise with unpaid chocolate bar. I tried to stay polite, because arguing over a chocolate at 6am isn\u2019t exactly how I like to start my day, but honestly, if I couldn\u2019t afford a snack from the minibar, I wouldn\u2019t be staying at The Umrao. Wild concept, I know.\n\nAnd just when we thought the morning couldn\u2019t get any better, my brother\u2019s car wouldn\u2019t start. Turns out, the valet\u2014clearly a seasoned professional of \u201c25 years\u201d\u2014forgot to switch off the headlights. When confronted, he assured us with full confidence that he would never do something so silly. Thankfully, the CCTV footage didn\u2019t get the memo\u2014because it clearly showed the lights were on all night. Oops. Eventually, my brother and the valet had to push the car while I sat in the driver\u2019s seat to jumpstart it. Just the kind of five-star valet service you dream about.\n\nTo their credit, one of the managers at checkout did try to smooth things over and was genuinely polite and professional. It\u2019s just a shame that the rest of the experience made it feel like we were on some sort of hidden camera show.\n\nWould I stay again? Probably not.

The room itself was actually a suite, with a separate guest sitting area and bedroom \u2013 much more spacious than most rooms in the same category. Breakfast was good, served in a cozy, relaxed setting. The property retains its old-world charm and heritage feel, though certain areas could benefit from some maintenance.

A lovely surprise awaited me in the room \u2013 \u201cWELCOME\u201d beautifully spelled out on the bed using bougainvillea flowers and leaves. The room itself was actually a suite, with a separate guest sitting area and bedroom \u2013 much more spacious than most rooms in the same category. Breakfast was good, served in a cozy, relaxed setting. The property retains its old-world charm and heritage feel, though certain areas could benefit from some maintenance. A calm, charming, and well-located choice for a short stay.",

One of the standout members was Rajkumar from housekeeping - very sincere and dedicated to his work. He ensured the linen was changed daily and maintained the overall cleanliness of the room to perfection. His attention to detail is truly commendable.\n\nI was also impressed when I pointed out a scratch on the toilet seat \u2014 the team explained it wasn\u2019t dirt, but still replaced the seat with a new one within 10 minutes without hesitation. On another day, I had to leave early and requested a sandwich before breakfast hours. To my surprise, they packed not just a sandwich, but also fruits, juice, muffins, and cupcakes \u2014 all ready by 6:45 AM!\n\nThe service and hospitality were exceptional throughout.

The washroom conditions are only average, and overall the property seems to be in need of refurbishment.\n\nThe service quality was average, with staff support not meeting expectations of a five-star property.

The bed was incredibly cozy and gave me the restful sleep I needed after the long journey. I especially enjoyed the breakfast spread \u2014 a great variety of fresh and flavorful vegetarian and non-veg options.

Despite its proximity to the airport, the soundproofing in the rooms is impressive, allowing for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep.\n\nAmbiance and Decor:\nUpon entering, you\u2019re greeted by a stunning lobby adorned with elegant decor and a welcoming atmosphere. The blend of modern and traditional Indian elements creates a warm and inviting space that sets the tone for the stay.\n\nRoom Quality:\nMy room was spacious and well-appointed, featuring comfortable bedding, a sleek bathroom, and all the amenities you could need, including a coffee maker and a mini-bar. The attention to detail was noticeable, from the quality toiletries to the plush furnishings.\n\nDining:\nThe dining options were superb. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast buffet with a wide range of choices, from local dishes to international favorites. The on-site restaurant also offers a fantastic dinner menu, showcasing the rich flavors of Indian cuisine.\n\nService:\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. From the check-in process to room service, everyone went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. Their professionalism and willingness to assist were truly commendable.\n\nAmenities:\nThe hotel features excellent amenities, including a well-equipped gym, a beautiful spa, and a lovely outdoor pool. These facilities added a relaxing touch to my stay, making it easy to unwind after a long day of travel.\n\nOverall Experience:\nI highly recommend the Radisson Blu Plaza Delhi Airport for both short and extended stays. Whether you\u2019re traveling for business or leisure, this hotel provides a blend of luxury, comfort, and convenience that is hard to beat. I will definitely choose this hotel again for my future visits to Delhi.",

From the moment you step into the hotel, you are greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that sets the tone for an excellent stay. The staff is incredibly friendly, courteous, and helpful, making sure that every guest feels comfortable and taken care of.\n\nOne of the standout employees at the hotel is Ms. Deepika Joshi, who is a star performer. Her dedication to her job is evident in the way she goes above and beyond to ensure that guests have a memorable experience. Ms. Mahima Kapoor, Mr. Amanpreet Sandhu, and Mr. Ravi are also outstanding staff members who provide excellent service and are always willing to help.\n\nThe front desk staff at the hotel, including Rohit, Ginni, Srikant, Gaurav, Gunmeet, and Shalinder, are all very friendly and professional. They make checking in and out a breeze, and they are always available to answer any questions or address any concerns guests may have. Their efficiency and friendliness make the stay at the hotel even more enjoyable.\n\nThe food at the hotel is delicious, and there are plenty of options to choose from. Whether you're in the mood for something light or a more substantial meal, the hotel's restaurant has something for everyone. The room boy, Adil, is also excellent, making sure that the rooms are always clean and tidy.\n\nIn addition to its great staff and services, Holiday Inn is also an excellent venue for events. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending a 2-day event at the hotel, and I was impressed by how well-managed it was by the hotel staff.\n\nFrom the planning stages to the execution of the event, the hotel staff was professional, organized, and attentive to every detail. They went out of their way to make sure that all aspects of the event, from the accommodations to the catering, were top-notch.\n\nThroughout the event, the hotel staff was readily available to assist with any needs or concerns that arose, and they were always friendly and accommodating. They truly made the event a success, and I would highly recommend Holiday Inn as a venue for any event or conference.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holiday Inn was fantastic, and I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

It's conveniently located within walking distance of many popular tourist destinations, such as India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhavan. The hotel also offers easy access to the city's major business and shopping districts.\n\nThe hotel staff was exceptionally warm and welcoming, making me feel at home from the moment I arrived. They were attentive to my every need, and their excellent service continued throughout my stay. The hotel's room was beautifully designed, spacious, and had all the modern amenities one could ask for. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was luxurious, with all the necessary toiletries provided.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the dining experience at the hotel's restaurant, Dilli 32. The food was simply outstanding, with a wide range of delicious Indian and international cuisine to choose from. The restaurant's ambiance was also top-notch, providing a perfect setting for a memorable dining experience.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were exceptional as well, including a well-equipped fitness center, a beautiful outdoor pool, and a relaxing spa. The hotel's conference rooms and business center were also top-notch, making it an ideal venue for business meetings and events.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Ambassador, New Delhi - IHCL SeleQtions to anyone looking for an unforgettable stay in Delhi.

The comfort of the bed was truly commendable, ensuring a restful sleep. The breakfast menu, featuring a delectable array of North Indian, South Indian, and continental dishes, was an absolute treat for the taste buds. The variety and quality of the offerings, set a positive tone for the rest of the day.\n\nHowever, what truly set this hotel apart was the exceptional customer service provided by the staff. Telephone calls were promptly and courteously attended by the front desk before my check-in. The airport pickup that they organized was spot-on.\n\nOn arrival, a special mention goes to Twinkle from security, who greeted me with warmth and enthusiasm at the main entrance. Twinkle took the time to give me a brief overview of the hotel's services and facilities, and she even went the extra mile by suggesting local attractions I could visit during my stay. She recommended using the hotel's cab service, which turned out to be a convenient and hassle-free way to explore the city. Ankit from the front office concierge proved to be extremely efficient in organizing a day trip for me in New Delhi. His attention to detail and willingness to ensure I had a fantastic experience made a positive impact on my trip.\n\nDuring check-out, Yogitha at the front desk was exceptional and continued the streak of outstanding service. She requested and checked the details and comfort of my stay. She offered to take a picture of us and bid us farewell with a warm smile, leaving me with a lasting positive impression.\n\nHowever, while the service was exceptional, there were a couple of aspects that didn't quite meet the mark. While the room had all the essential amenities, there were some subtle touches and finishes that were lacking, impacting the overall luxury experience. Additionally, the wellness area left a bit to be desired. I was surprised to find that there was no sauna or steam room available, which I had been looking forward to.\n\nDespite these minor setbacks, I appreciate the efforts of the staff in making my stay memorable and enjoyable. With some enhancements to the room quality and wellness amenities, this hotel could easily reach the full five-star experience that its exceptional service deserves. I look forward to seeing how this establishment evolves in the future and hope to return for another visit.",
