Our overall experience was excellent, and I'm pleased to share this with future travelers. My kids even picked up some lovely souvenirs during checkout, adding a special touch to our stay.

ahm002,ahm002_r2,vikas parmar,5,"I recently visited ITC Narmada - The Luxury Collection in Ahmedabad with a friend, and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is top-notch, offering luxury and comfort in every aspect. The service was outstanding — the staff were highly professional and ensured our stay was both comfortable and enjoyable.

One unique and convenient feature of this hotel is the in-house liquor shop. Since liquor purchase in Gujarat requires a permit, the hotel assists guests by providing a letter which helps in obtaining a liquor permit easily. This makes it one of the few hassle-free options for buying liquor in Ahmedabad.

Overall, highly recommended for both business and leisure stays!",2025-07-31T08:28:11.181031689Z,a month ago

Dinner at the speciality restaurant Peshawari was an experience that was somewhat spoiled by the noisy groups who were not urged by the staff to maintain decency in the restaurant.

I had misplaced my gold ring in the room and realized it only a couple of hours later. I immediately called the hotel to request that no one enter the room until I returned. To my surprise, the room had already been cleaned and the gold ring was safely placed within the room by the housekeeping staff.

ahm004,ahm004_r3,Arvind Bhat,4,"First the good points- Full mark for service & hospitality. The dining service and the front desk service goes all the way to serve customers needs. They are truly exceptional and are a great example of Indian hospitality.

However the rooms and the general lack of up keeping is what let's the hotel down. The lower floor rooms are very dated and in need to maintenance. During the course of 3 days stay we changed 3 rooms due to problems in room cleanliness, ac issue, etc. Biggest concern is that the rooms in 9th floor all have ac condensation issues and you end up with wet and sticky floors all the time. The other issue around general cleanliness and maintenance is obvious- rooms have mould, chipped wooden fixtures, rusted door frames, etc. Even the lifts are outdated with broken/ rusted panel board.
While these issues can easily be ignored in a 3 star or even 4 star hotel, this is not acceptable in a hotel advertising themselves as a 5 star. Additionally I have never seen a 5 star hotel that don't provide amenities like hair dryer as part of standard bathroom fixtures or have concierge or travel assistance services.

Overall my stay was made memorable only by the service of staff and I am not impressed by hotel amenities in any way. Come up with expectation of a 4 star hotel and you will be satisfied.",2025-08-17T08:07:19.833802937Z,3 weeks ago

We recently dined at your restaurant and had the pleasure of being served by Sumit. From the moment we were seated, Sumit impressed us with his warm demeanor, attentiveness, and utmost professionalism. He was courteous, well-informed about the menu, and ensured every part of our experience was smooth and enjoyable.

His calm and polite approach made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for. It’s rare to encounter service that combines efficiency with such a personal touch, and Sumit delivered that perfectly.

Thank you for having such a wonderful team member—he truly enhanced our evening. We look forward to visiting again and hope to be served by Sumit in the future!",2025-06-18T06:34:02.984286903Z,2 months ago

ahm011,ahm011_r4,Antriksh Mittal,1,"Our experience was unfortunately quite disappointing. We checked in around 8 PM, and even at that hour, our room was not ready. No welcome drinks were offered upon which was included in our booking.

The front desk staff, particularly the lady who assisted us, did not inform us about any of the inclusions that came with our room booking. Thankfully, we were already aware of them — otherwise, we would have missed out entirely. We also had to wait nearly two hours for the extra bedding we requested, and only one towel was provided for three guests. The lack of basic communication and attentiveness at the front desk was very frustrating.

Cleanliness and Maintenance:
The hygiene standards were far below acceptable. The washroom was especially concerning — the commode had visible urinal stains, which was extremely off-putting. As a result, we avoided using the washroom throughout our stay. There was no hot water in the shower, and the mini fridge had visible fungus inside it. This level of cleanliness is unacceptable for any hotel, let alone one in this price range.

Room Condition:
The room had excessive humidity and moisture, likely due to the air conditioning being left on continuously. The walls felt damp to the touch, making the environment uncomfortable and unhealthy.

Breakfast:
The breakfast was fine — perhaps the only decent part of our stay.

Final Thoughts:
Honestly, we would prefer to stay at a Holiday Inn or Ibis in the future. Not only are they often more affordable than Priza Plaza AHM, but they also consistently offer better service, cleanliness, and guest experience.

I hope the General Manager of the property reads this and work on the accountability followed by rectification because the staff at the front desk and housekeeping is ruining the brand value",2025-08-22T13:06:52.497062544Z,2 weeks ago

ahm015,ahm015_r1,Sameer Pagare,5,"The Hillock is an example of how a hotel should be!

We stayed here on my girlfriend's birthday (17th August), and honestly, it turned into one of the most memorable stays of our life. We got a great deal from Agoda at ₹6800 with breakfast included, and every penny felt worth it.

1️⃣ Ambience & Interiors – The ambience is super classy. The interiors, detailing, and artifacts used around the property are simply marvelous. It gives you the feeling of staying in a boutique luxury hotel.

2️⃣ Rooms – Spacious, elegant, and full of comfort. The lighting is soothing, the bed is large and cozy, and even small details like the study table and decor give a premium vibe.

3️⃣ Washrooms – Believe me, I never thought I’d enjoy a washroom so much! The shower setup was so perfect that I didn’t feel like coming out. Absolute pleasure.

4️⃣ Restaurant – A beautifully designed restaurant offering both international and Indian food. Dinner was à la carte with plenty of delicious options, and the best part – they have 24×7 restaurant service.

5️⃣ Service – This is where The Hillock shines. From the seamless check-in to the restaurant team, housekeeping, and security – everyone goes above and beyond to make you feel valued. The staff is not just professional but genuinely warm and welcoming.

6️⃣ Breakfast Buffet – A grand spread! From sweets to North Indian, South Indian, and even authentic Gujarati dishes – they had it all. We enjoyed it so much that we promised ourselves to come back.

✨ Special Mention – Shiva from the restaurant team. His professionalism, dedication, and ever-smiling service stood out. People like him make hospitality feel personal.

✅ Tips for Future Guests:

Ask for a top-floor room – Better lighting, quieter, and you might get a nice view.

Don’t miss the breakfast – Come hungry, it’s worth it!

Try late-night dining – Since the restaurant is open 24×7, enjoy a midnight meal or dessert.

Special Occasions – Inform them in advance (birthday/anniversary). They go out of their way to make it special.

Nearby Attractions – The location is central, so plan a short evening stroll around. There is a newly opened mall named CBD.",2025-08-18T16:35:11.404008503Z,2 weeks ago

However, what truly made our stay exceptional this time, was the outstanding customer service, particularly from Mr. Lohani. We were travelling with our two autistic sons, and it is very important for us to have interconnecting rooms, wherever possible, so we could ensure their comfort and safety.

Thanks to his efforts, we were able to relax and fully enjoy our time at this beautiful hotel, knowing that our boys were safe and close by. It is rare to come across staff who not only provide excellent service but also show such professionalism, understanding and compassion, and for that, we are truly grateful.

Also, it was already informed or known that three guests are staying in the room, yet only amenities for one or two people were provided. Basic essentials like towels, toiletries, and water should be arranged accordingly in advance.

While the staff members are polite and well-behaved, they appear to be quite confused and disorganized. It seems there is a lack of proper coordination or training. The room service is also very slow — they take a lot of time to respond or deliver anything, which affects the overall comfort of the stay.

Another thing - housekeeping didn't bring body towel. The worst thing was that I realized it after bathing. Complaint to reception, next day they bring two towels. But both with spots and dust. After second complaint housekeeper brought two new towels. And no apologises, like it was something routine.
I will never recommend this hotel to everyone, and inform my HR not to work with this hotel.",2025-08-06T13:38:27.545273513Z,a month ago

Reasons as follows:

1. Damp smelly corridors and rooms.
2. They have hostel rules, any guest is not allowed to go in room after 7 PM. This was bit of a bummer.
3. They switch off the AC if you sit too long in the cafe/lounge.

I had a wonderful experience at Hotel Royal Comfort. From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel welcomed and well cared for. Check-in was smooth and efficient, and the room was clean, spacious, and thoughtfully arranged with all the amenities I needed.

The in-house restaurant served delicious food with a good variety on the menu, and the breakfast spread was impressive.

- The lack of readiness in food quantity and timing.
-The taste of food was not at all as per the standard of five stars standard.
- The unprofessional attitude of the floor manager and senior manager.

Traveling from London, we were looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming hotel—and Nalanda went above and beyond our expectations.

The hotel offered an exceptional breakfast experience every morning, with a wide variety of both Indian and English options, all fresh and delicious. The hot breakfast was particularly impressive, with great attention to quality and presentation. It was clear the kitchen team takes pride in their work.

We also had regular dinners at the in-house restaurant, Spice Village, which deserves special mention. Every meal we had there was excellent—delicious food, a rich and varied menu, clean and pleasant ambiance, and attentive staff. It became our go-to place every evening.

The hotel staff, across all departments, showed great professionalism and warmth. The reception team on every shift—morning, afternoon, and night—was exceptionally helpful and polite. They were always ready to assist, whether it was with local guidance, housekeeping needs, or arranging transport. Housekeeping was efficient and kept our room clean, fresh, and well-stocked every day.

One thing I deeply appreciated was the presence of the hotel’s owner. Every time he visited the hotel, he would greet us with a genuine smile and respectful eye contact. That personal touch made a big difference and reflected the caring culture of the hotel.

The location of the hotel is also excellent—peaceful, yet centrally located with easy access to shopping areas, eateries, and cultural spots. The overall cleanliness of the hotel, the comfort of the rooms, and the consistent quality of service made our long stay truly enjoyable.

To sum up, Nalanda Hotel offers everything a guest could ask for—comfort, cleanliness, delicious food, friendly service, and a sense of being truly welcomed. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ahmedabad, whether for business or leisure.

Thank you, Nalanda Hotel, for making our stay so memorable.

I will definitely be visiting again later this year and am already looking forward to another great stay.

Booked 2 rooms for 3 and 4 nights respectively.
Room: seepage issues and damp walls. Carpets were torn from the ends. Cleanliness compromised.
Complimentary breakfast: had booked both the rooms with breakfast BUT ...
On the days when we were not present for the breakfast, we requested for a packed breakfast which was plainly regused by chef Ankit saying that packing is not allowed. Since this was a long stay so spoke to F$B manager Jeevan who agreed for this. And we were given 3 small pcs of sandwich and half a bowl of fruits as a packed breakfast. Felt so disgusted that I returned the boxes to the front office.

Buffet: the property has a lunch and dinner buffet running on all days. We had checked in at 2 pm so straightaway went to the restaurant and enquired about the charges. We were quoted rs 1500 + 18%taxes. In the evening, we got to know that dinner is priced at 1500 whereas lunch buffet is 1200 and they had a monsoon offer running which offered lunch buffet at 799 but this was not communicated to us.

Sowmanty at the front office is polite and listens patiently. Aamir at front office, Ankit and Jeevan at the restaurant seemed troubled and seemed as if they r there to trouble the guests. Just a fake smile doesn't help. The staff should hv proper information and the courtesy n intent to help.

For a small information had to write 6 emails to the manager which were responded at ease.

Paid 42000 as room rent for a total 7 nights stay but the experience was not pleasant.
Would avoid this property n ITC group as a whole since had a bad experience at ITC bangalore too.

1. The rooms are comfortable and carpeted. However, you might notice a few odd spots on the carpet—I saw some during my stay (just a few though).

2. The lift didn’t feel very welcoming. The panel inside was covered with plywood. I hope that’s just a temporary fix for maintenance.

3. The service is excellent. The hotel staff are warm, welcoming, and keep you well informed.

ahm030,ahm030_r4,Dharamvirsinh Bhati,5,"We have recently stayed at this 4-star hotel and was thoroughly impressed by the overall experience. From the moment we walked into the elegant lobby, we were greeted with warm smiles and efficient service at the front desk. Check-in were smooth, and we appreciated the staff’s attentiveness and willingness to answer any questions I had.

The room was modern, clean, and tastefully decorated. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the linens felt high-quality. We especially liked the thoughtful touches, such as a well-stocked minibar, ample closet space, and a cozy seating area. The bathroom was spacious and featured both a rain shower and premium toiletries, which added a nice touch of luxury.

The hotel offers a great range of amenities. The on-site restaurant served a delicious breakfast buffet each morning, with plenty of variety to suit all tastes. We also dined there in the evening, and the food was flavorful and beautifully presented. The gym was well-equipped, clean, and quiet—perfect for a quick workout.

What really stood out to me was the excellent service. Every member of the staff was professional, courteous, and genuinely eager to help. They went above and beyond to make sure guests were comfortable and well taken care of.

If I had to mention one area for improvement, it would be the sound insulation between rooms—it wasn’t a major issue, but I could occasionally hear noise from the hallway.

Overall, this hotel offers exceptional value for a 4-star property. It’s ideal for both business and leisure travelers who want comfort, style, and top-tier service without the ultra-high price tag of a 5-star stay. We would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a refined yet welcoming hotel experience.",2025-04-04T03:38:33.261714Z,5 months ago

I came for a wedding of a family member. Prior to our arrival, there were rats found in a room where another family member was staying.

There wasn’t WiFi in the rooms.

The toilet in our room was broken and would continually flush without manual intervention.

Hot water wasn’t available in the shower.

The sheets had visible stains.

There were gaping holes in the ceiling of a common corridor outside of the rooms.

The staff only offered to clean our room once
during our four night stay.

The staff sleep in the common areas early in the morning, on the couches to be used for guests.

ahm031,ahm031_r4,Raveena Nath,1,"Very Disappointing Stay – Not Worth the Price

I recently stayed at Arya Grand Hotel, Ahmedabad, and it was one of the most unpleasant hotel experiences I’ve had.

The washroom was extremely dirty, constantly wet, and had no ventilation, making it feel suffocating and unhygienic throughout our stay. To make matters worse, the water from the washbasin had a foul smell and didn’t feel clean or fresh. This is a serious hygiene concern that cannot be ignored.

There was no Wi-Fi, which was unexpected for a hotel at this price point. The food was a complete disaster – we paid ₹700 for an aloo paratha that was completely average and tasteless. The pizza was even worse – you can get a better one from a roadside vendor.

While the property looks grand from the outside, the maintenance is shockingly poor. At ₹3,000 per night, this was absolutely not worth the price.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, or value-for-money stay. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and improves both their facilities and service.",2025-07-04T06:47:40.020762022Z,2 months ago

On top of that, There are very limited food options available. I was expecting a wide variety to choose from—especially since this is a well-known five-star property—but unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case,

secondly the used plates and leftover food were left outside our room until noon. No staff came to clean up the mess, which was both unhygienic and unpleasant to look at.

To make matters worse, I went to the pool area hoping to spend some quality time with my family, only to be denied access because we didn’t have swimsuits. After paying a premium for the room, it’s frustrating that they couldn’t accommodate us for even a few minutes. There was no flexibility or hospitality in their approach.

ahm035,ahm035_r1,Vani SEO for Restaurants,1,"Terrifying and Unresolved Incident – Felt Unsafe and Unsupported

I booked a 4D3N stay at The Cama – A Sabarmati Riverfront Hotel from 4th August 2025. My experience started off normally, but what happened on my second day has left me deeply shaken and feeling unsafe.

On the morning of 5th August, after taking a shower in my bathroom, I looked at the mirror and saw a message appear: “Updesh ❤︎ Vani.” This was extremely disturbing because no one at the hotel knows me as “Vani” (my ID and booking name is Shivani), and the message looked like it was written by hand on the mirror. I immediately took a photo and informed the front desk.

The receptionist was polite and offered to change my room, which I appreciated, but the unease never left me. That night, I felt so anxious that I left to stay with a friend’s family.

The next morning, I returned to the hotel to request CCTV footage of the 3rd floor outside my room (307) for the hours before my check-in and while I was out. Initially, the Front Office Manager seemed supportive, but after hours of waiting and being stalled, I was told they could not show me the footage due to “policy.” Eventually, the General Manager told me outright that they would not provide the footage and suggested I go to the police instead.

For a guest’s safety concern of this magnitude, I expected the hotel to be transparent and cooperative. Instead, I faced delays, avoidance, and a complete lack of accountability. There was no explanation for how that writing appeared on my mirror or whether someone had entered my room.

If you value your safety, privacy, and peace of mind, I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel.",2025-08-08T06:39:52.932154304Z,a month ago

The owner is also very well experienced, polite, down to earth & a practical person, who has created a great management team & regularly guiding & inspiring them to perform at their best.
All the staff is very polite, well behaved & ready to serve the guests. We were regularly visiting the hotel from March to June & stayed for 3 days. NO ONE FROM US & ALL THE GUESTS, EVER HEARD A ""NO"" FOR ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE STAFF.
Karishma, the decorations manager, also helped us all the way & prepared the stages of new design to the full satisfaction as demanded by the wedding couple.

Specially the one in reception
The alloted room was isolated, not so good vibes, i requested them to change next day as I was staying for 3 nights.
In morning they said they will and in evening when there were more customers standing they straight away say NO.
Housekeeping nos was not working at all
Everytime had to reach to reception.
When I called for late check-out as my train was in afternoon the staff started arguments to start and later they agreed
It was my offcial stay but I am surely gonna inform this to rest of my colleagues as this was not at all coperative approach and it made my stay bitter.
On top of it the gym was not working, buffet they show price as 1299/- and show you 50% off where as in any 3 or 4 restaurants or even in buffet restaurants it's not even worth of 700/- It's scam.
The breakfast was also not upto the mark, Dhoklas were very cold and dry. They didn't even put efforts to replace it.
I asked manager for Ghee to pour on idli but he didn't had it.

ahm041,ahm041_r4,Debashis Roy,4,"This was my second stay at the property, chosen primarily for its convenient location right off SG Highway—ideal for business travelers like myself. The hotel offers easy accessibility, making commuting hassle-free whether you're headed to meetings in the city or nearby corporate hubs.

The rooms are generously sized, with ample space to move around comfortably, and the bathrooms follow suit—clean and well-maintained. However, soundproofing could certainly use attention. While external noise from the highway is present, it's not overly disruptive. What’s more noticeable is the lack of privacy between rooms; on certain occasions, I could hear conversations from the neighboring room, which detracts from the overall comfort.

As a vegetarian hotel, they offer a buffet dinner that is modest in its offering—not exceptional, but reasonably good considering the price point. If you’re not expecting culinary finesse, it does the job for a simple evening meal.

The absence of an iron in the room was a small inconvenience, particularly on an official trip, and the internet connection was inconsistent—something that the management should prioritize for business travelers.

Overall, while not without its flaws, the hotel offers value through spacious accommodations and strategic location. With minor upgrades to amenities and soundproofing, it could elevate the guest experience significantly.",2025-07-24T15:47:47.231029309Z,a month ago

-Free breakfast
-Very clean

I chose to stay here because the reviews were very positive and stated that the hotel is very clean. They also accept foreign passports (surprisingly many other hotels in Gujarat don’t). We were greeted by a nice gentleman who helped us with our bags. The room was very fresh and clean, the bed and bathroom were also nice and clean. The room had air conditioning and a decent view of the street and surrounding buildings.

The staff in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. The food was some of the best I have had during my whole time in Gujarat. I recommend you check out the restaurant if you stay here (they also offer room service).

When we had our room cleaned it was a quick but thorough job, they made our bed and cleaned the floor too which was great.

This place is walking distance from the riverfront which is a decent spot for a walk if you want to avoid the crazy traffic on the roads and the western side of the riverfront walk is mostly shaded in the late afternoon.

Overall it has been a great stay and I found the price very reasonable especially considering the quality of the place.

1. Comfortable and cozy room
2. Cleanliness was excellent
3. Staff was very polite and helpful
4. Hotel is energy efficient and frivolous expenditures are avoided. Hotel promotes lesser wastage and green energy . The things that I noted in this regard are as follows:
a. The room water was served in glass bottles. Water was of excellent quality. No plastics at all.
b. Toiletries were not supplied separately. It reduces cost and consumption. All the essentials were in permanently kept dispensers.
c. Linen, bedsheets and towels were clean and fresh.
d. Hot water temperature was controlled.
e. Room temperature could be controlled.
f. Iron board and a steam iron was provided which was extremely helpful.

Besides these positives, I noted a few negatives too, which if taken care off can get you more appreciation
a. Food quality (taste) can be improved.
b. Since GIFT city is still under development, I believe you will be very nicely placed in future. Today, the dust and distance (from the rest of city) is one downer.

I’m not sure what I booked for since photos seemed similar, but initially the room which was given was surprisingly very small, and uncomfortable. Upon requesting we were given a much better room, which took few hours for them to do, and felt worth the price paid for. I really appreciate the management for this kind gesture.

They need to work on the service, as I felt there was no courtesy amongst the staff to take the luggage to the room, even when I was dragging it all by myself.
The hotel is well maintained and clean. Rooms were also well maintained and clean.

Food being served during the breakfast was good, but not excellent. They need to improve especially little more on the quality of the beverages given. The juices were all watery. Tea served was not hot enough.
Food options were limited.

ahm054,ahm054_r2,Aditya Solanki,1,"A Disappointing Experience at an Otherwise Beautiful Property

We recently stayed at this property for one night and paid over ₹35,000 plus taxes. While the hotel itself is undeniably beautiful—with a stunning ambiance, well-maintained interiors, and potentially one of the best locations we’ve visited—our experience was unfortunately tarnished by the attitude and behavior of the front office staff.

From the moment we arrived, the welcome lacked warmth or hospitality. We were especially disappointed with the conduct of Ms. Piya and the manager, Mr. Drishya. Instead of being accommodating and courteous, as one would expect at a luxury property, their tone was dismissive, unhelpful, and frankly, disrespectful. Basic courtesy and professionalism were completely missing, which left us feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout our short stay.

When guests choose a premium hotel and pay a substantial amount, we expect not just good infrastructure, but a high standard of service and hospitality. A beautiful property alone does not define a good experience—it is the people, the service, and the attention to guest comfort that truly make a stay memorable. Sadly, the staff we interacted with seemed to lack both the training and the attitude required to work in hospitality.

I sincerely request the management team to take this feedback seriously. No matter how well-designed or luxurious a property may be, it loses its charm when the front office—the first and last point of contact for guests—fails to uphold basic standards of hospitality. With the right staff and guest service training, this property can truly live up to its potential.

Until then, I would not recommend this place, simply because no guest paying such a premium should have to tolerate being treated rudely.",2025-07-29T09:11:15.508746241Z,a month ago

I want to give a shout out to the FnB HoD and Puja (from the hotel restaurant) for their hospitality. The hotel room given was spacious. It had all the amenities. It was a bit difficult to get house keeping done at night but they did a really good job executing all the requirements. The shower wasn’t having consistent water temperature but was manageable. The lighting in the entire hotel was a bit dim. I was a solo female traveller and felt very safe in and around this property. The people at the reception were kind, sweet and hospitable too.

ahm054,ahm054_r5,Maulik Shah,1,"They said the hotel is fully booked but I didn't see more than 10-15 guests anytime of the day.

In spite of repeated reminders that we want early check-in we were given rooms at 2 ' O clock ( as per their check in time. And check out time is 11 ' O clock)

Rs 1200 per person per meal we paid.

At dinner we had a full menu from soup to dessert.  But after 1:30 hrs wait. We got only roti, sabji, simple boiled rice and dal fry. Couz they were not able to cope with the other 25-30 guests. All other guests were also in the same situation as we were. Don't know what it takes 1:30 hrs to make just a roti , sabji and dal .

In 2 days our room key was disabled thrice. So we cannot use the lift and also go to our room.  When I asked the receptionist she said you have your phone with you that's why it is happening like this. The second time after coming from the swimming pool the same happened. When I had nothing with me.

Beware they are speaking sugary but nothing in their services.

They will try to sell rooms of the upper category saying all 50-60 deluxe rooms are booked..which is not possible except there is a function.

The road outside the club is pathetic. Full of pot holes, gutter water .  During rainy season it's big No.

Overall the experience was not at all good.

If you want to just stay without any food inclusion in the package then have it as a low cost option . You will get rooms at a far better price.",2025-06-30T03:28:57.257785187Z,2 months ago

I had to come down and request at the reception to give another room, to which they agreed for rupees 1500 per night extra.
Now they gave us a room on the second floor. This room was spacious. But again there is no cupboard in this room also.

I am 30 years old and I could not get up from bed. Then how can I expect my parents to get up.
Also the food menu given in the room was non veg. I had read in goibibo for reviews that the kitchen was pure vegetarian. I called in the reception and checked. They say the hotel is pure vegetarian. Then why will you give me a non vegetarian menu in the room??
Breakfast was included for 2 days.
I must mention the breakfast was very good.
The lift is too small.

On arrival, we found that the room lacked toiletries, and hot water was not available. However, upon informing the staff, they promptly fixed the hot water issue, which I appreciate. Despite this, the room had a strong, musty odor, similar to the damp smell often experienced during the rainy season, which made the stay less comfortable.

Overall, the service was outstanding, but the hotel needs to focus more on room maintenance and cleanliness to enhance the guest experience. With a few improvements, this could be a great place to stay!",2025-04-04T12:25:35.695293Z,5 months ago

ahm063,ahm063_r1,Ankush Dhadwal,1,"I have never seen such a poorly maintained hotel in my entire life, especially for the price I paid for this hotel. First, I entered the room, the bedsheet was not changed because I could see the hair of the person there who was earlier staying in the room. Then the pillow cover had a stain of hair oil, indicating it was not changed. They just sweep the floor. They didn't even have the will to mop the floor, clean the bathroom.

The receptionist was very cruel. He intentionally switched off the AC from the MCB so that he can save 1 unit. When I confronted him, he blamed me that I had turned on the button and the moment I entered the room, he turned on the AC from the main board.

The ceiling was leaking. It was not possible to wash your hand because sewage water was dripping on the wash basin.

Because of them, I decided to change the midnight because I couldn't bear the pain of sleeping in an unhygienic condition.

You can also see the picture clicked in midnight where I'm leaving the room as their helper is unlocking the main gate from where we have to enter.

Please don't go with the fake reviews which they had posted here. They have used bots to fabricate their review so that people like us can fall into their trap.

• Rooms are absolutely full of cockroaches, making it unpleasant

• AC leaking water nonstop, had to call the maintenance guy 2-3 times to get the issue resolved after 4-5 days

• Flush not working properly

• Lift was out of service most of the time

• Intercom issues

• Executive room felt cheap and poorly maintained

• No dining area for breakfast,lunch,dinner

Definitely Not 4-Star

The pictures of this hotel are very misleading. What looks like a spacious, 4-star property online turned out to be a huge letdown from the moment we checked in.

The staff is rude, inattentive, and seems completely untrained in basic customer service. The rooms are much smaller than shown in the photos, only the European-style decor stands out, but that's about it.

There’s no hot water available 24/7, just lukewarm water at best, which was frustrating. The breakfast is below average...expect poha, dosa, paratha, tea, and bread-jam. If you're expecting a proper buffet or anything close to 4-star quality, you’ll be disappointed.

The rooms are quite good, though the bed is a spring bed and a bit too soft, so I’d suggest the hotel owner consider changing that because some guests might have back pain. Also, the rooms are a bit small, but if you pay a little extra, you can get a bigger room. It's perfect for two people and very stylish. The bathroom is also very neat and clean, and the staff is very helpful. They provide a kettle with tea, sugar, and if you need more, they give it free of charge. There’s also a fridge in the room, and overall, it feels like a 3-4 star hotel. Initially, I was given a room with no window at the back side, which felt a bit closed in, so I asked for a room with a window at the front, and it was much better. I really enjoyed my stay.
The breakfast there is also really good and has a decent variety. If you include it in the package, it’s even better, but if not, you can still get the buffet breakfast for just 180 rupees per person. I really liked it, and I’ll share a video of the breakfast room. I did forget to take photos of the rooms and the bathroom, but I’ll definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. It’s close to the station, just about 125 rupees by cab, and it’s only around 3-4 kilometers away. The area is great, right in front of Kankaria Lake, so you can go for a stroll.

The hotel is part of Agora Mall; hence, there are many food options available in the mall, including a food court and a 24-hour café   As female travellers, we felt that the surrounding area provided a sense of security.

During our two-day stay in mid-August 2025, we discovered a cosy, pleasant room with a bathroom that was kept up nicely by the hotel. The room has a minibar and an electric kettle. A hairdryer was available on demand.
Hotel Staff – The front desk and housekeeping are humble and polite. We kept our luggage for 6-7 hours at reception. The area is well maintained and secured with CCTV. We even waited for 1-2 hours after checkout at reception, as we had a late-night flight.

ahm072,ahm072_r2,Ananya Murudkar,1,"Review Title: Disappointing Stay – Poor Hygiene and Unprofessional Staff

I recently stayed at Hotel Tribeca in Gandhi Nagar for just one night and, unfortunately, had a very disappointing experience.

The room we were given had no windows, which made the space feel extremely closed off. Even more concerning, we found cockroaches in the room — a serious hygiene issue that made the stay uncomfortable.

The staff’s behavior was unprofessional. We had ordered tea and were mistakenly given a portion for two. When we clarified that we only wanted one portion, we were still charged for two, and instead of resolving the issue politely, the staff was dismissive. The most shocking moment was when a staff member removed items from our table — including sugar — while we were still eating. This was not only rude but also extremely unprofessional.

The only positive part of the experience was the security guard at the entrance, who was genuinely kind and helpful.

Overall, the lack of cleanliness, poor staff etiquette, and unpleasant atmosphere make it a place I would not recommend. I hope the management takes these issues seriously and improves both hygiene standards and staff training.",2025-07-14T15:17:11.069826253Z,a month ago

ahm078,ahm078_r1,Prateek Sarthak,2,"I recently stayed at this hotel, and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. From the moment I stepped into the room, I was met with an unpleasant odor that made it difficult to stay inside for long. The cleanliness of the room was severely lacking – the floors were dusty, the bed linens seemed unwashed, and the bathroom had stains and an awful smell. It was clear that proper housekeeping was not a priority at this property.

The foul smell in and around the hotel was unbearable, making the stay highly uncomfortable. It seemed to be a mix of poor ventilation and lack of deep cleaning. The air conditioning unit did little to help, as it only circulated the bad odor instead of improving air quality. Additionally, the common areas, including the lobby and hallways, also had a musty smell, further indicating a lack of hygiene standards.

Suggested Improvements:

Deep Cleaning: Rooms should be thoroughly cleaned before guest check-in, including proper vacuuming, dusting, and sanitizing of all surfaces.

Odor Control: The management should use air purifiers, room fresheners, and regularly clean AC filters to eliminate bad smells.

Proper Waste Disposal: Ensuring garbage is disposed of regularly will prevent foul odors from accumulating.

Better Ventilation: Installing exhaust fans and improving airflow can help remove lingering odors.

Regular Inspections: The housekeeping team should conduct routine inspections to maintain cleanliness and hygiene.

A hotel stay should be a comfortable and refreshing experience, but unfortunately, this one was stressful and disappointing. Until significant improvements are made in cleanliness and odor control, I cannot recommend this hotel to other travelers.",2025-02-24T10:17:44.791838Z,6 months ago

ahm080,ahm080_r3,Aditi Shah,5,"We recently hosted a dinner event in Dev Viman Hall at the house of MG.

Santoshbhai was an excellent host. He was very accommodating in terms of adding a few items to the decor and menu. He listened and answered each question with great patience and attentiveness.

The entire staff was very cooperative, polite and treated the event as their own. Starting from Ashwainbhai, Chehraji, Vikrambhai, Razabhai, Wahidbhai and a few other people on the reception and in the valet team that I am forgetting. Each person had their complete attention on the nitty-gritty of the event. If something was amiss, they were eager to make it as per our request.

Our photographer termed the decor as the backdrop of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. The ACs were fully working. The decor was done impeccably. On our request, they also included coloured rangolis near the entrance in addition to the flowers, diyas and brass divis on the entrance, foyer, hall and on the tables.

We hosted a sit-down dinner, which felt very intimate and beautiful in this space. The staff was very helpful in rearranging and removing some of the furniture as we had imagined our sit-down to be.

All the necessary items for the cake cutting were ready on an already decorated table. The cake was well stored in the fridge for a few hours. The music system was initially not working, but they made it work, and it was heard throughout the hall.

The food is as always amazing at the house of MG. We had an elaborate menu. One of the staff members also came in to recommend a few of the chutneys, which was a really nice personal touch. At the end of the event, when we were done dancing, they also offered tea and coffee refreshments which were not in the menu initially. The rotation drinks and starters were continuously rotated. Drinks were again offered at the end.

House of MG is a very well-maintained property and I have seen renovations happening from time to time. It can feel like a more expensive option compared to the rest of the halls, but the charm and heritage of this place combined with their wholehearted service and attitude of giving fully is unmatched. Since it’s all-inclusive, you won’t have to worry about the decor, valet or food having to be arranged from different agencies.

ahm081,ahm081_r1,subir paul,4,"Diwan’s Bungalow – A Standout Heritage Stay in Old Ahmedabad

Let’s get straight to the point: Diwan’s Bungalow is a 150-year-old heritage property right in the thick of Ahmedabad’s Old City, and it delivers a unique blend of historic charm and business-friendly convenience. The property’s architectural details—classic wooden furniture, expansive verandas, and period décor—have all been thoughtfully preserved, but you still get the essentials: reliable air conditioning, updated bathrooms, and the kind of modern touches business travelers expect.

Location-wise, you’re in the center of everything. Major markets, quick access to the railway station, and plenty of options for dining or meetings are just steps away. That’s a huge plus if your trip balances work and exploration. There’s a catch, though: the city’s energy is always present. Street noise—honking, traffic, the usual city buzz—can run late into the evening. For light sleepers, it’s worth coming prepared or requesting a quieter room.

On the tech side, Wi-Fi is complimentary, but the signal strength isn’t consistent throughout the property. If you rely on a strong connection for video calls or urgent work, this could be a minor frustration. Investing in a mobile hotspot or the hotel upgrading their access points would be helpful.

Service? Really impressive. We arrived well before standard check-in, and Mr. Mahendra Chaudhary’s team welcomed us without hesitation or extra fees. That level of flexibility and hospitality is a real asset for business travelers who often deal with odd arrival hours.

Bottom line: if you value distinctive, heritage-rich accommodation with genuine service and central access for business or leisure, Diwan’s Bungalow is a smart choice. There are minor drawbacks—city noise and spotty internet—but the overall experience and atmosphere far outweigh them. I’d recommend it to travelers looking for more than just another standard hotel.",2025-07-27T11:40:44.437453240Z,a month ago

ahm083,ahm083_r1,Modinsab Horakeri,4,"The resort is conveniently located near the S.P. Ring Road, offering easy access. The property is expansive, featuring vast green spaces and well-maintained golf fields—though access to the main golf area is restricted for guests.

The rooms have a rustic, old-fashioned charm with wooden interiors and minimalist features. While not modern, they offer a cozy and peaceful ambiance.

Indoor sports facilities are excellent and well-maintained. Do note that proper sports attire and shoes are mandatory to use them. The mini golf area stands out as a fun and engaging spot, and there’s a decent play area for children as well.

However, the dining experience was underwhelming. The food quality and presentation at the restaurant were below average, and the breakfast spread was quite limited. Some items even lacked freshness, which was disappointing.",2025-07-20T16:38:12.718642370Z,a month ago

From the moment I arrived, the check-in process was smooth and quick. I was welcomed in a unique way – with innovative ice lollies! A fun and refreshing start to my stay that definitely made a strong first impression.

The hotel’s wall painting décor really stood out – artistic and eye-catching, it added a creative charm to the ambiance. Absolutely loved it!

My room was luxurious and well-equipped, featuring two cozy single beds, and all the modern amenities you’d expect – an electric kettle, mini fridge, locker, comfortable slippers, and a clean, spacious bathroom. A special mention to the personalized welcome by the management – such a thoughtful gesture!

The in-house restaurant truly impressed me. The breakfast spread was extensive, offering a great variety from cakes and pastries to delicious vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I was especially impressed by the customized dishes prepared by the chef – top-tier flavors and presentation!

Fitness enthusiasts, you’re covered too – the hotel features a well-equipped, spacious gym. And for those planning events or meetings, there’s also a large banquet hall and a professional board room available.

ahm085,ahm085_r5,Samaira Aggarwal,1,"My stay at the Regenta Inn, Ranip, AMD was nothing short of a harrowing experience. I went on a school trip with 80 girls which was my only compulsion to stay at this pathetic, health hazard place.
1. We had to eat disgusting and uncovered food being munched on by flies.
2. We had to get our room changed thrice on account of different pungent smells in each. One of them even had seelan in it which half of my strong perfume couldn’t overpower.
3. The staff was churlish and interacted with us rudely as we were students — which, as I believe — is no criteria to decide how to behave with your guests.
4. The linen, oh, the linen had so many stains on it. Got it changed multiple times, but even then, I had to put my t-shirt on the pillow and then sleep on it. I’m not kidding.
5. Hey Regenta, if my friend wants hot water for her nasal wash, you just give it to her or replace the stinking kettle in the room. You don’t tell us you’re going to do that and then leave us hanging.
6. Salty water would be an understatement for the kind of water here. Khara pani would be better. Felt as if they took water right out of the Sabarmati river and gave it to us. Most of us got rashes.

Therefore transport and access become my highlights here.

There's also a gym available, not very spacious but enough to complete your daily exercise if you wish to.

However, the room was not up to my expectations. Decoration seemed quite dull and too old-fashioned. I'm not sure if it's meant to be like this or simply is a category that they are missing to pay more attention to. Decoration shouldn't be an issue if you just stay overnight but it definitely affects your comfort and adjustment to the place if you stay over two nights, specially considering the amount of money which is being paid. It also felt quite empty. Just basic amenities. But I suspect it was the lack of charm what made me develop this opinion.

Lastly, I was not very comfortable with the lady at the reception.
She was not rude, but she used to observe so much whenever I would come in or leave that I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about the same. I appreciate when people act more discreet in this regard.",2022-10-31T18:43:47.194302Z,2 years ago

ahm088,ahm088_r4,Arijit Das,1,"Extremely Disappointed—Not Worth the Rating or Price

I stayed in **Room 208** at **Biznotel by Pride, Motera, Ahmedabad** on July 30, 2025 (at around 10:30 PM). I booked this for two single guests through Chhattisgarh Tourism sponsorship. We were shocked to find that when we requested an **extra duvet (kombol)** from reception, we were told **none were available**—despite paying ₹12,000. This felt more like a ₹500 budget lodge than a property advertised at a much higher standard.

The situation deteriorated further when we asked for a bedsheet 30 minutes later—still no response, no delivery. We were left wondering if even basic linens existed.

Staff behavior was completely unacceptable. The receptionist was unresponsive, and when we raised the price, there was no assistance. To me, this property lacks the **basic competency** to run a hotel. It is absolutely unfit to carry the Pride brand.

**Recommendations:**

1. Please list a **director or grievance e‑mail** on the company website so guests can register complaints and suggestions directly.
2. Ensure adequate stock of **basic linen and bedding**—even in standard rooms.
3. Train staff so they offer **courteous, responsive service**, especially when guests pay premium rates.
4. Improve accountability—delays of over 30 minutes to provide a bedsheet are **unforgivable**.

**Summary:**
This was a deeply unpleasant experience at a hotel charging premium rates. I hope that the management reads this review, addresses the failures in service and infrastructure, and takes immediate corrective action.",2025-07-30T17:39:00.872907885Z,a month ago

Dear Hotel Management Team,

I am writing to formally express my disappointment regarding my recent stay at your hotel. Unfortunately, I faced multiple issues that caused me to check out much earlier than planned.
•	The first room provided to me was extremely dirty and unhygienic, with visible insects (please find the attached picture as evidence).
•	After raising this concern, I was given another room. However, in that room, the Jacuzzi did not have warm water, and the shower area also lacked proper hot water supply.

Due to these inconveniences, I had no choice but to check out around 9:00 p.m. on the same day. Considering the discomfort and poor service I experienced, I kindly request a 50% refund of my booking amount as compensation.

I trust you will look into this matter seriously and process the refund at the earliest. I hope for a positive resolution and better hospitality standards for future guests.

Sincerely,

First it didn’t look anything like pictures from the inside of the room! Room they gave was all dirty and had stained walls!
A dirty bed with stains like a cheap 500 rupee kind of a room it was and they charged so much for it!
Washrooms were equally dirty and bad and it had moulds on the ceiling because of moisture in the washroom as there was neither a source of ventilation nor exhaust fan! Washroom didn’t have any of the lotion or shampoo, also their sink leaked the entire time.

When I got tired of all this then came the challenge with good! It’s a townhouse and no matter what portal or where you book it from, they show buffet/free breakfast as their key feature, it wasn’t there and their paid food was really bad in taste!

ahm094,ahm094_r5,Manojkumar Jha,5,"Hotel German Palace - An Exceptional and enjoyable Venue
Overall Experience:

Our family's (both groom's and bride's) stay at the Hotel German Palace during my daughter's wedding week was truly extensive and immensely enjoyable. The hotel played a pivotal role in making one of the most important events in our lives a resounding success, bringing together our extended family seamlessly.

Accommodation & Stay:
We had an enjoyable and relaxing stay in the hotel rooms. They were sufficient and comfortable for all family members, providing ample space for everyone. The hotel staff was highly responsive to our needs, promptly supplying any extra amenities or requests we had throughout our stay.

The Event & Management:
Hosting a large, traditional North Indian wedding in Gujarat over two main event days (plus a week of festivities) was a significant undertaking. The German Palace team managed it exceptionally well,alleviating considerable stress.

Pre-Event Planning: The collaboration started well in advance. The events team, including Shivani Ji, engaged in detailed planning and discussions regarding various customs and event schedule. Crucially, they took full responsibility for the designing and decoration of all venues. The overall design quality and execution were excellent and greatly appreciated.

Event Execution: They expertly handled the complex schedule of customs:
Day 1(3 june-25) :-Tilak, Goad Bharai,Lunch, Haldi, High Tea, Mehndi,Bhat, Sangeet, Dinner
Day 2(4 June-25) :- The Wedding Ceremony (Bharat arrival, Ring ceremony, Jaimala, grand lunch, kaniyadan, High Tea, phere, Bidai, Dinner)
Banquet Facilities: We utilised multiple banquets and halls available on-site. (Two Nos- at ground floor & third floor) The spaces were perfectly suited for our events, with halls comfortably accommodating 150 - 200 guests each. We also utilize hotel front space for grand lunch.

Technical support (sound, lighting, AV) & decorations was readily available and reliable throughout all events, ensuring everything ran smoothly.

Guest Coordination: Handling guests traveling from both North India and Gujarat was flawless, showcasing the team's experience and hospitality acumen.

Culinary Excellence:
The food served throughout the events was a major highlight. It received widespread praise from our guests for its exceptional quality, authentic taste, and impressive variety, perfect for us. I’d say, if you’d like to get yourself a good meal, do visit their restaurant Spice Affair too.
Staff & Special Mention:
The true strength of the German Palace lies in its people. The entire team provided outstanding service throughout the planning, organization, and execution phases. They were dynamic, responsive, and insightful. Special recognition is due to Shivani Ji , whose critical insights, adept problem-solving, and leadership were invaluable in ensuring everything ran smoothly.

Hotel Facilities & Service:
The hotel itself is impressive and was widely appreciated by our guests. Key strengths noted include:
⁃	Attentive and Courteous Staff: Across all departments
⁃	Efficient Room Service: Prompt and reliable.
⁃	Dynamic Operations: Demonstrated excellent handling of complex situations and large volumes.

Location Advantage:
The hotel's location proved to be a significant asset. It offers convenient access to key points such airport, railway station and hospital too.

Lastly, we are sincerely thankful to entire team of the hotel German Palace for this memorable experience.",2025-07-06T09:32:17.157286461Z,2 months ago

ahm102,ahm102_r5,Anand Singh,1,"My experience at Lucky Chicken and Mughlai Restaurant was disheartening. The tandoori chicken, while a staple favorite, disappointed with an excessive saltiness that overwhelmed the palate. Even more disappointing was the Mughlai chicken, which oddly tasted like a standard paneer gravy, lacking the expected richness and flavor profile.

The service, unfortunately, was the low point of the visit. The waitstaff displayed an alarming lack of attentiveness and receptiveness, making it challenging to communicate concerns or preferences. This significantly impacted the overall dining experience, leaving a bitter taste beyond the unsatisfactory food.

For those conscious of their well-being and budget, this establishment may not be the ideal choice. The potential mood-lifting power of a good meal was overshadowed by the frustration caused by the subpar culinary offerings and service. The only saving grace was the availability of Sprite, providing a semblance of refreshment amid the disappointment.

Given the concerns raised about hygiene and overall service quality, it might be worthwhile to advocate for AMC to take corrective action. Aiming for improvement in such areas could enhance the overall reputation and appeal of the restaurant.",2023-11-12T07:51:32.828904Z,a year ago

ahm103,ahm103_r4,Hiren Mukhi,1,"There are much better and economical hotels in the vicinity.

Location: Near a mosque, risky as it gets dangerous/shady post 10pm. Not at all recommended if you are from a decent family and if you are traveling with family. It is in the old city but you can get better hotels on Ashram road which is quite close to the city or you can try Air bnb.

Staff: Friendly but suspicious.

Rooms: Small, not clean, and definitely not a 3 star category. It is a self proclaimed 3 star. I would say it is an upgraded motel. I think they also hide cameras. The toiletries provided are also sub standard.

Breakfast: Just check where they prepare it and you would know the hygiene.

If you are a cleanliness freak please don't visit. Not sure how they got a 3.9 star definitely lot of fake reviews.

To make matters worse they called me early in the morning to rush my checkout, I thought of a 24-hour policy.

The reception was making the excuse some pest control is going on but the real reason was that they had given the room to some other boarders.

ahm110,ahm110_r5,K Patel,1,"Terrible Experience with Hotel Riverfront – Do Not Book!
I had a very bad experience with Hotel Riverfront booked through Goibibo. When I arrived, there were several vulgar men sitting outside the hotel, staring uncomfortably, which already made the environment feel unsafe.
When I approached the reception and informed them about my booking, the staff member completely ignored me and continued talking on the phone, seemingly just wasting time. I had to repeat myself and raise my voice before he even acknowledged me.
After that, I provided my and my partner’s ID for check-in, but he immediately denied us without even properly reviewing the documents. He didn't even look at our Aadhaar cards and just said he needed the original ID (even though we had valid ones). I suspect he had already given our room to someone else since we checked in late — almost 8 hours after the check-in time.
When I questioned him, he rudely insisted that our documents were not acceptable and claimed that no hotel in Ahmedabad would accept them, which I found to be completely false. There was also no parking space available, and I noticed a tow truck nearby — so if you park outside, your vehicle may be towed.
I was extremely disappointed and had no choice but to look for another place. I lost my money on this booking. Thankfully, I found Hotel Prince Plaza, just 500 meters away, with great reviews. The staff there were polite and helpful. The receptionist welcomed us with a smile, didn’t ask unnecessary questions, and checked us in smoothly. The room was clean, with a coffee machine, hot water, and even a good chef on-site.
My advice: Do NOT book rooms at Hotel Riverfront. You risk losing your money and facing rude behavior. I will also be filing a formal complaint on public forums and consumer complaint boards.",2025-06-01T08:49:23.398556Z,3 months ago

Most of the passengers staying here were employees of some medical company.And the food options here are also not much.

🍽️ Food – Tasty & Hygienic:
While the hotel doesn’t operate a large restaurant, they do offer home-style meals, tea, and snacks on request, and everything is hygienic and prepared with care.

💰 Great Value for Money:
Given the quality of service, location, amenities, and comfort, Hotel ABC offers exceptional value for money. Whether you’re traveling on a budget or looking for premium service at a reasonable price, this place is hard to beat.

ahm124,ahm124_r1,Wandering Soul Journal,1,"I chose this hotel because of the good reviews online, but my experience was disappointing from the start. We couldn’t even find the place easily. We had confirmed our arrival for 2–3 PM but ended up arriving around 6 PM. We called ahead at 5:30, and they said the room was ready. When we got there, someone was still cleaning the bathroom, and the strong smell of bleach made the room uncomfortable.

I booked the Royal Suite. The AC didn’t work properly, and even after reporting it, no one showed up to fix it. The shower pressure was weak, and the “free breakfast” was barely worth mentioning.

We paid the remaining balance in cash at night since we had to leave early. When we asked for a receipt, the front desk staff said they’d give it to us before checkout — we never got it.

What bothered me the most was the staff pressuring us to write a review on the spot. My brother was asked to scan a QR code, write the review while the staff watched, and then the staff even took a photo of it. I was asked too, but I refused and said I’d do it later.

Still he didn't give a clear yes that room could be available that is subject to availability(later on i came to know hardly half of rooms were occupied). Next day i requested early check in and reception guy instead of making things easier asked wait,room is not ready so i waited for like 20 min and then he asked for cancelling that booking which i wasnt aware of made by customer care executive. Receptionist talked rudely and didn't care as if i was asking for free room and asked to cancel that booking i didn't know how to.

2. Now AC rooms/ single beds approx 6-8 beds inside a lage room.( It lacks ventilation, I felt hot and uneasy. Located in a bottom/downstairs od this dormitory. Here it's single beds no bunk beds.)

(I will suggest going for AC bunk beds. Avoid NON AC it's suffocating with a bad smell.)

Advantages
1. Good AC bunk beds available
2. Nice reception
3. Storage options available for each. (Small/medium luggage space.)

Disadvantages
1. Their are lots of hotels in this name. (Hence, I went their to check physically) - Now you can see the details in the photos attached.

2. Offline booking and Online booking check out timming may vary (i.e. offline booking has a advantage of 24 hours check-out.But online booking traveler may face some issues. I suggest to call them).

ahm134,ahm134_r1,Hardik Parmar,2,"Hotel Bhavy Villa, Ahmedabad – 2-Star Review

Hotel Bhavy Villa is an average budget hotel located in the heart of Ahmedabad, making it suitable for solo male travelers looking for a low-cost stay in a central location.

The rooms are decently sized, but the washrooms are extremely small and congested. There are major issues with the water supply—water is often not available in the early morning, and there are frequent interruptions at other times as well. The water pressure is very low, the toilet flush doesn’t work properly, and the water geyser is not functional.

Cleanliness is also below standard. Bedsheets, towels, rooms, and washrooms are not cleaned properly, which could be a concern for many guests.

Overall, the hotel may be acceptable for a short stay by solo male travelers with minimal expectations, but it is not recommended for families or anyone seeking basic comfort and hygiene.",2025-05-12T11:50:24.095609Z,3 months ago

I had booked a one-night stay at Gokul Villa FabHotel after checking the photos and reviews online. Unfortunately, my actual experience was completely different and very disappointing.

As soon as I arrived at the property, I was shocked by the entrance and the overall look of the place. It gave off a very shady and unsafe vibe—completely different from what was shown online. I didn't feel comfortable or secure enough to even enter the building.

I made the quick decision to not check-in at all and immediately booked another hotel at my own expense. I had already paid for this stay, so both my time and money were wasted. But for me, safety and peace of mind come first.

This experience was upsetting and frustrating. I hope FabHotels takes such cases seriously and ensures accurate representation of properties on their platform in the future. Based on this incident, I have lost trust in booking stays with FabHotels again.

The conditions of the stay have been far below even basic standards, and certainly not what was advertised or expected when booking through your platform. The following are the serious issues we have encountered:
•	Broken doors within the room, compromising safety and comfort.
•	Glass doors are improperly sealed, allowing constant traffic noise and making it nearly impossible to rest.
•	Large gaps around doors and windows allow mosquitoes and insects to fly in, causing severe discomfort.
•	The room was not serviced for two full days—no cleaning, no fresh linen, no replenishment of essentials.
•	The dustbin was never emptied, and the bathroom remained filthy throughout our stay.
•	The geyser for hot water is non-functional, and the water that does come through the taps is foul-smelling and unfit for use.
•	The air conditioning system worked intermittently at best, leaving the room unbearably hot and humid most of the time.

The level of service and condition of the facilities at Treebo King Plaza are completely unacceptable and fall significantly below the standards promised. We trusted Treebo to provide us with a comfortable and reliable experience, but this has been nothing short of a nightmare.",2025-04-10T10:12:08.729377Z,5 months ago

The hotel is conveniently located near the bus stop and train station, making it easy to access. The building is quite new, but a large part of it is still under construction. The rooms are decent—nothing fancy but sufficient for a short stay.

The staff is friendly but seems inexperienced, which reflects in the overall service. They do offer food, but the menu is very limited. There is a small 8-seater dining area (around 10x10 in size). Breakfast was included in our booking, but they served only one item, which was quite basic.

Issue 2: Feedback on My Experience at Hotel Shaligram Inn, Ahmedabad

I am writing to share my recent experience at Hotel Shaligram Inn, Ahmedabad, dated 25th March, 25 which was disappointing due to a lack of professionalism and poor communication.

At the time of booking on booking.com, I had explicitly requested an early check-in, two hours before the standard time. I received an email confirmation stating that the Shaligram Inn hotel management would try to accommodate us upon arrival. I also directly contacted the hotel to confirm the request via phone and WhatsApp, and there were no objections from their side.

However, on the day of my visit, the management was uncooperative and dismissive. Without even checking room availability, they firmly refused any possibility of accommodating the early check-in. Their tone was aggressive, and they displayed a lack of professionalism and basic customer service etiquette.

Despite the initial inconvenience, I managed to convince them to hold my luggage while I waited for the standard check-in time. This unnecessary delay caused a significant disruption to my plans. Although the rest of my stay was smooth and comfortable, the staff’s attitude and lack of hospitality left a lasting negative impression.",2025-03-28T14:36:29.758753Z,5 months ago

ahm149,ahm149_r3,Rajat Chaudhary,1,"Never booking with Sarovar again. Very shady pricing mechanism, I had booked a room 2.5 months in advance to get the best rate possible and to my surprise the rates actually came down by almost 1,500 per night during the dates on which we had booked. When asked about the difference, the manager arrogantly said that we follow dynamic pricing and there will be difference in pricing every day. Understood, but the concept of dynamic pricing is to get more yield as the rooms get filled up and not the other way around, maybe in the parallel economics which they are following the principals work the other way round. So, in the end I ended up paying INR 9,000 extra for the three rooms I booked because I was stupid enough to think that I will get a better pricing if I book early (BIG MISTAKE) and on top of that they charged INR 1,000 for providing an extra MATTRESS in one of the rooms. So, all in all I had to shell out 11,000 extra for booking early. So my suggestion to anyone booking with them is to never book early as their DYNAMIC PRICING fundas work I the opposite direction. And yes the rooms are ok but the washrooms are just passable for the amount they are charging, the bathing tubs were dirty and toilet seats were old and not properly cleaned and you do need to call them to turn on the hot water if you need to take an early shower.

ahm150,ahm150_r4,Sagar Soman,2,"Disappointing Stay Experience – Poor Housekeeping Standards

I stayed at this hotel recently during a conference, and unfortunately, the housekeeping was a major letdown. The rooms were dusty, cupboards hadn’t even been opened or cleaned, the locker was non-functional, and the hangers were dirty – indicating a serious lack of attention to detail. It seemed like the room had received only a very superficial and patchy cleaning, just enough to cover the basics.

This made for a truly pathetic experience, and had it not been for the conference being held at the same venue, I would have definitely switched hotels. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone planning a comfortable stay.

That said, I must mention that the conference hall and the restaurant were excellent – top-notch food and a very courteous restaurant staff. Unfortunately, the good dining experience couldn’t compensate for the poor condition of the room.

Verdict: Great for events and food, but if you’re staying overnight, be prepared for sub-par housekeeping.",2025-07-12T03:38:02.237602028Z,a month ago

ahm154,ahm154_r2,Rajeev Gupta,1,I booked this hotel online for my wife and son and when I reached the hotel the reception manager did not allow me to be there with them for even 2 hrs. I had a train to catch and just went there to drop my family. His logic was that even for two hrs I needed to book for three people whereas I had no plan to stay and just after lunch to catch the train. He was very rude and told me that he has 40 hotels and he is right. His language was also not appropriate for the hospitality industry. Highly unprofessional behavior. He said that when I will stay for two hrs I will use their facilities and toilets. What is this? I have visited many of my friends and family several times as a guest but no one told me that even to go to meet someone in the room and using toilets we need to pay them. I then told no problem I will stay at reception for two hours but then my wife told me she cannot stay in a hotel where the staff is so rude that even for her husband does not allow it. In fact the restaurant staff who were at junior level understood and told me that I can use the restaurant toilet. The hotel was booked on no refund basis but as my wife was not feeling safe we came out and booked another hotel. Also complained to the cleartrip but the manager refused to accept any apology and provided no refund. The hotel has a very bad entrance and I don't know how it will be from inside. It is the first time I have seen that the hotel has a front dhaba spoiling the front of the hotel and no parking. I suggest not to book or consider this hotel as staff is very rude and may not be safe also. I don't have any option for zero stars That's why I have to give one. Actually it should have minus stars.

Housekeeping did not clean the bathroom which still smelled strongly of urine and used soaps/hygiene products were still in the washroom. Bedsheets were covered in assorted stains and did not look like they had even been changed since the last customer. We had to change 2 rooms to be comfortable enough to stay the night. We were told breakfast will be 7am to 10:30AM but when we asked staff if we could come and eat by 9:45AM, we were told that breakfast is finished so you will have to manage. Outside food like Swiggy/zomato are NOT ALLOWED to be ordered at the hotel and so if you do not eat by the prescribed times, you can starve or walk to the nearest restaurant in the middle of the night endangering yourself. Airport transfer cab was included in our stay but refused to stop anywhere along the way to allow guests to purchase supplies and/or eat something before being dropped.

Location of this hotel is 5 minutes from the airport and is the ONLY thing about this hotel that makes sense. They have decent reviews online but hotel photos listed on the booking websites are very old and do not represent its current state.

The hotel’s proximity to the airport—just about 5 minutes by car—made it an ideal choice. Their complimentary airport drop-off service was a big plus and saved us the hassle of arranging transport.

We had booked one Executive and one Deluxe room. Both rooms were clean and well-maintained, with basic amenities in place. The Executive room was a bit more spacious and had a better layout, while the Deluxe room was compact but still comfortable. Beds were cozy, the bathrooms were clean, and the ACs worked well in both rooms.

The staff was courteous and responsive throughout our stay, which made the experience smoother, especially when traveling with family. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was average—limited spread and not particularly flavorful—but it served its purpose. On the other hand, lunch and dinner at their in-house restaurant were genuinely enjoyable, with fresh and tasty dishes that satisfied both adults and kids.

The hotel ambience is simple and functional—don’t expect luxury—but for a short stay, it’s perfectly adequate. They also allowed us to store luggage after check-out, since our flight was later in the day, which was really helpful.

Rooms are no way maintained or cleaned and looks same as it has been shown in Photos. Wall paints are coming off, bathroom door was broken. So many issues in a hotel and room, can’t describe here in my words. Somehow managed to survive till next day and checked out.
Location wise it’s near to Airport other wise nothing good in this hotel. Worst experience!!",2024-07-17T06:27:59.370114Z,a year ago

ahm161,ahm161_r2,Rakesh Shahi,1,"I checked in around 9:30 PM and informed the reception that the TV in my room was not turning on. They acknowledged the issue and said someone would check it shortly. I waited patiently.

Around 10:00 PM, I called the reception again to follow up, and they said it would take a bit more time. I still remained patient.

However, by 11:30 PM—after waiting for two full hours—I personally went to the reception to check on the status. To my surprise, I was informed that the issue couldn’t be fixed. I then requested either a replacement TV or a room change, but the response I received was extremely disappointing: “It’s too late, we can’t do anything now.”

This response was completely unacceptable. If the issue couldn’t be resolved, I should have been informed earlier, not made to wait unnecessarily for hours. The lack of communication and unwillingness to provide a proper solution reflects poorly on your service standards.

I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and ensures such situations are handled more professionally in the future.",2025-06-17T20:26:14.980005061Z,2 months ago

I booked and paid for a hotel room in advance, but on arrival, the hotel manager said the booked room wasn’t available. He offered a dirty, smelly alternative with damaged walls or suggested I cancel and stay at a friend’s hotel.

I tried calling OYO immediately, but no one responded, so I emailed the same day. No refund has been issued even now. Shockingly, the support team later asked me to revisit the hotel and click pictures to prove my claim—how unreasonable!

I was a tourist and this ruined my trip. All I received from OYO was repeated apologies and no actual solution. Very unprofessional and insensitive service.

My stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing and far from what I expected for the price charged.

Cleanliness & Hygiene:
The rooms were stinky and infested with insects. After complaining, they sprayed air freshener, which barely masked the smell. The bathroom was even worse, with water not draining properly during the shower, making it unhygienic and unpleasant.

Services:
There was no tea or coffee service available. The landline in the room didn’t work, and no drinking glasses were provided. Even the basic amenities were lacking, and the staff offered no help.

Value for Money:
This hotel is not worth the amount charged. Despite taking money inclusive of GST, they provided only a plain estimate bill, which even small shops wouldn’t do.

This hotel fails in cleanliness, service, and professionalism. I would never recommend it to anyone.",2024-12-20T15:10:58.569067Z,8 months ago

-Dirty bedsheets and pillow covers with previous persons hair on them.
-When I entered before drinking water I checked whether the full water bottles were sealed, they were not sealed.
-Food is expensive and unhygienic, if you have flights its a risk not worth taking.
-Nearby there is no eateries, if the manager tells you there is he is pointing to some street shop down the lane that is hygiene risk
-I booked my stay for 3 guests In one room with mattress and paid for 3 people, the third person (child) was given a towel in January winter in the name of blanket. On asking for a proper blanket I was given one more towel.
-sleeping is impossible here as the tune of elevator music is heard the entire night and staff shouting and moving around. I had to catch up on sleep in the flight.

ahm171,ahm171_r1,HARESH GANGWANI,1,"Hotel Review: ★☆☆☆☆ (Should be zero stars)

This was, hands down, the worst hotel experience of my life — and I’m not exaggerating. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. Calling it a ""hotel"" is an insult to the word itself.

From the moment I stepped in, I regretted booking it. The lobby smelled like a mix of mold and cheap disinfectant. The staff looked bored, irritated, and completely uninterested in helping anyone. I was made to wait 30 minutes just to check in, even though no one else was at the counter.

The room? An absolute nightmare. The bed was sunken in the middle and covered with suspicious stains. The sheets were clearly unwashed — I found hair and even what looked like crumbs between them. The bathroom was a horror show: cracked tiles, black mold creeping along the shower walls, and the toilet didn’t even flush properly. There were bugs. Yes, actual bugs crawling on the floor and walls. I felt disgusted just touching anything.

There was no Wi-Fi, no hot water, no soundproofing. I could hear the couple next door arguing all night, dogs barking outside, and what sounded like construction at 2 a.m. It was like trying to sleep in the middle of a war zone.

Honestly, this place should be shut down by the health department. It’s dirty, unhygienic, loud, depressing, and run by people who clearly don’t care. It felt like a punishment just staying there.

Do yourself a favor — sleep in your car, a park bench, anywhere but this disaster of a hotel.",2025-05-28T04:25:09.791884Z,3 months ago

ahm175,ahm175_r5,Vishesh Jaiswal,4,"Hotel Ashish is definitely one of the better budget-friendly hotel options in Ahmedabad and comes highly recommended for its strategic location. It’s conveniently situated with easy access to many of the city's major attractions, and the railway station is just a short distance away, making it ideal for travelers arriving by train.

We booked a Deluxe AC Room, which was clean, well-maintained, and spacious enough for two people. The bed was comfortable, and the room hygiene was satisfactory. However, if you’re expecting a scenic view or balcony, you might be disappointed as the rooms don’t offer much in terms of outside views.

Our booking included a complimentary breakfast, but we found the food to be quite average. If you're a foodie or looking to try local specialties, it’s better to skip the breakfast package and explore the nearby local eateries instead — Ahmedabad has plenty to offer in that department!

Earlier I thought not to review this hotel as they don't deserve to get my review, but....

Experience with this Oyo was worst. The staff was pathetic.

Situated in red light type area. Roam around hotel after 9 pm and see yourself. When we booked auto from airport to go to this hotel, auto wala asked, sir koi ladki wagereh cahiye to bolna mereko. We (me and my friend) ignored that guy but when we roam around the hotel nearly 9 pm, I can't share what we saw. I think this was the reason behind whatever auto wala asked.

One staff of this hotel don't bother to knock the door. He came in the room again and again even when we didn't called him.

Highly Not recommended for family and couples

Only one small soap and a towel.
""Us hi soap se dho lo, naha lo, hairwash
kr lo or moisturize kr lo""

3. Rooms were not cleaned properly and smelling. On asking them to apply room fresher, one of the staff empties the whole room fresher in the room. I have to open the window and door for the next half an hour to make the over smell go away.

4. Breakfast served in the rooms was very limited. I got only 1 small paratha and that's all.
""Breakfast tk bhar pet nhi mila""

5. Next day, that limited breakfast also gets over before breakfast timings. I called for breakfast and they said they will serve in some time and later on simply said sir checkout ka time hone wala hai ab ..!!
Like who's supposed to bring the breakfast when I ask them to bring in @9 in the morning...!!

The location is also convenient, with easy access to nearby transport and essential services. The overall ambiance of the hotel was peaceful and welcoming.

One suggestion would be to expand the food menu a bit more. While the current offerings were tasty and well-prepared, adding more variety—especially in regional or continental options—would enhance the dining experience further.

The staff was a bit rude but perhaps, that’s how people speak in Ahmedabad.
The service was prompt though.
The rooms were clean and properly maintained but they had no view whatsoever.
They provided just towels and soaps in bathroom amenities.

ahm196,ahm196_r4,Jay Shah,1,"I recently stayed at this hotel and I must say it was an incredibly disappointing experience. I feel compelled to share my feedback in the hope that it might lead to improvements in their service.

1.	Room Cleanliness: The rooms were shockingly untidy upon arrival, with visible signs of neglect. Not what you’d expect from a reputable establishment.
2.	Lack of Housekeeping: It took an astonishing 10 reminders to the staff before our room was finally cleaned. Unacceptable and inconvenient.
3.	Security Concerns: Our room was found wide open at 10 pm, just as we left it at 12 noon. A clear security breach that left us deeply unsettled.
4.	Unsupportive Customer Care: The customer care service was unhelpful and unsupportive throughout our stay, which only added to our frustration.

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone. Such a subpar level of service and disregard for guests’ well-being is unacceptable in the hospitality industry.

I stayed at **Iconic Hotel** last night, and it was a wonderful experience. 🏨✨

The pressure shower was amazing 🚿💯 and the bed was extremely comfortable 🛏️😌.

The staff were incredibly cooperative and supportive 👏🙌 – we arrived late at night 🌙 but they went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

The only small challenge is that the hotel is located a bit inside a residential area 🏘️, which might make it slightly difficult to find at first. But the team is very helpful and even sends people to guide you 🧑‍🤝‍🧑➡️, so don’t be discouraged by the surroundings.

Once inside, you’ll be pleasantly surprised 🤩.

The location is incredibly convenient for travellers, especially those catching early morning or late-night flights. Just minutes away from the airport, Hotel Iconic offers a stress-free and time-saving stay.

The rooms are clean, modern, and well-maintained, with comfortable beds, fast Wi-Fi, and all essential amenities. The peaceful ambience, despite being so close to the airport, is a big plus. The staff was exceptionally courteous, professional, and always ready to assist with a smile.

The in-house restaurant serves fresh, flavourful meals, and the breakfast spread was healthy, diverse, and satisfying.

What impressed me most about Hotel Iconic was the high standard of cleanliness, safety, and service. It’s not just a place to rest — it feels like a thoughtful, well-managed hospitality experience.

I had to call police by dialing 100, then they allowed me to check in.
Never ever go to this hotel. Everything is poor except the hotel charges which is very high.
They will switch off your A.C from outside switch. Water will always be not there in taps.
They will pass vulgar comments on you in Guzarati so that they can abuse you and you donot understand.

* Located in a Muslim are area.
* No Veg restaurant nearby, you will have to go to end of the road near railway station where you see 3 good veg restaurants.
* Road is too much crowded and traffic. Even if the veg restaurants i mentioned is just 300m away you will not be able to walk. Everyone on road are rash driving and you will not find any way to walk.
* Due to Too much traffic, that it will take atleast 30-40 min to reach railway station which is only 1km away. If you think you can walk 1km, even that is not possible in that road.

1. There should be a room spray for rooms and lobby, for good ambience.
2. There should install toilet roll paper in washroom.
3. 2 water bottles in a day should be complementary (although they provide R.O. water)
4. Shower towels should be replaced.

ahm218,ahm218_r1,Yogesh Maurya,1,"Very Poor Experience – Basic Facilities Missing & Unsafe Environment

I recently stayed at this hotel and, unfortunately, the experience was far from pleasant. I’ve stayed at many budget hotels before, but this one was particularly disappointing for the following reasons:

1. No Direct Control Over AC or Geyser

Every time I wanted to switch on the AC or geyser, I had to call or walk down to the reception. This was highly inconvenient, especially at night or early morning. I've never experienced this kind of restriction in any hotel.

2. Water Supply Issues

There were times when no water came from the tap, which made basic hygiene and usage difficult. This is a fundamental facility expected in any hotel room.

3. Dirty and Poorly Maintained Room Conditions

As shown in the pictures:

The window glass was dirty, broken, and covered with temporary plywood panels, making the room feel unfinished and unsafe.

The AC installation looked unprofessional, with wood and patches stuffed around it.

Worst of all, the elevator had a broken glass panel, which is not only dangerous but gives a very poor impression about safety and maintenance.

This stay felt completely uncomfortable and not worth the price paid. I strongly urge the hotel management to improve the infrastructure, fix safety hazards, and provide guests with control over basic amenities.

Until these issues are resolved, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2025-07-09T10:58:18.184976061Z,2 months ago

This place is a well-known hidden gem. Hidden in the sense that the narrow streets and alleys leading to the property from the main road don’t allow vehicles (only the bikes of local residents) which creates a peaceful walk from Dhal Ni Pol, despite only a short walk from Manek Chowk. It is also easy to grab a tuk tuk or uber or train from Dhal Ni Pol to anywhere in the city.
The place itself is pure tranquility, beautifully decorated and maintained, from quaint decor to vintage Haveli doors.
The bedroom is spacious with the most comfortable bed! And the bathroom gives ample space to wash and change with a separate shower and toilet.
The place is managed by two guys, Bansi and Dipak. Both are so helpful, flexible and friendly, they offered and made breakfast for me before my morning departure. Breakfast will leave you full and setup for the day and includes omelette, toast, paratha, fruit, juice, tea/coffee.

ahm242,ahm242_r3,Chaitanya Deep,3,"Not an ideal place to stay longer than a day or two. It's more of a homestay than a hotel. We stayed for 3 nights and 4 days. Our experience was great on the first day and kept going downhill throughout. The owner doesn't stay near the property so the caretakers do the bare minimum to keep it running and nothing more. It's good for a one night stay but not worth it for a longer duration.

Cleanliness:
The bed and table tops were clean when we checked in. The washrooms were clean. But there's a lot of dust everywhere else. The carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. All the cupboards, corners were dusty. The water heating kettle had insects in it. The fridge is just s show piece. The caretakers don't clean the rooms, washrooms during the stay.

Comfort:
The stay is comfortable and the room is spacious. There are two rooms and we could hear the conversation of people from the other room and the caretakers loudly speaking downstairs late in the night. The place is closer to the market road where you can take an auto or cab.

Hospitality:
We were served complimentary breakfast. And we paid for dinner at 450/person. The first night the dinner was a good quantity but later it was barely enough. On the last day, the service was completely inexistent. We asked for hot water and had to go downstairs and get it ourselves. We asked for a breakfast, he said he's making it, we had to wait for more than an hour and go downstairs to remind him again when he started to actually do it. He didn't even clear the plates after we ate.

Other issues:
Some person named Mukesh at the building asked us to lie to Agoda customer support, cancel the reservation on it and pay him in cash for the same amount. When we didn't do it, he shouted at us in anger. We were charged 500/hr for a late checkout which we were informed of only after 12. I kept asking for a bill but we didn't receive any and the owner is unresponsive on calls or messages.",2024-12-30T12:40:47.428229Z,8 months ago

His humility, politeness, and willingness to assist with anything you need make him an integral part of the experience.

ahm245,ahm245_r3,Ruben Peterkin,1,"The worst hotel i’ve ever stayed in- rooms are disgustingly dirty, no windows, bed sheets covered in stains looking like someone didn’t make it to the toilet. the walls are covered in greasy head stains and marks. hostile staff who do not make you feel welcome at all. On our last day the manager/owners were screaming and shouting at fellow guests right outside our room for 20+ minutes. DO NOT STAY HERE- the rooms are ridiculously overpriced for what they are. Dust everywhere and LOOK AT THAT BATH MAT- looks like a dead dog! find somewhere else to stay, do not recommend at all",2024-12-08T09:35:50.656309Z,9 months ago
