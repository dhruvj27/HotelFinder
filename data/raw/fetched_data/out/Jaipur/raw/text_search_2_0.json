A stunning property with an extraordinary staff that is so focused on serving and while a few touched us deeply, one can see the same amount of explicit passion across all. We were completely mesmerised by the property and especially those peacocks plus the other birds who were not shy to come make friends with us for a little bit of knick knack!!! Oberoi\u2019s is known for its personalised experience and we felt it first hand yet again!!! A special mention of Harshita, a passionate intern - you have a long way to go Harshita, all the best; Golu - who we want to thank for an interestingly humorous conversation and mocktail tasting; Virendra- thanks so much for making the experience so special for our twin daughters, Priyanshu loved your courteousness and your recommendations for breakfast and last but not the least to Triambika for the most sumptuous Rajasthani cuisine experience. Your smile can make anyone\u2019s day!!! Loved it all!!!",

The hotel is super clean, the rooms are set up in a very beautiful way, the beds are hard (I love this), and the area felt very safe and clean. The family is in the house and always say hello and the family style dinner table is a lovely touch )you order your own meal but can eat together). The cook, Govind, is absolutely amazing and made us feel so at home during our stay! Would definitely recommend to everyone.",

But as soon as we reached, we had to carry our luggage ourselves to the reception because there was no bell boy available to help. We checked in a room but the curtains there were torn, so they shifted us to another room. As soon as we entered the another room, the room was so small that even our luggage bag could not be opened. The balcony was also very small. When we complained at the reception that these were not the category of rooms that we had booked, the receptionist said that this is heritage property and all the rooms here are same. The pictures on the internet are just for reference. We were very surprised but they ignored us. The tea bags provided in the rooms were also open and not in proper packaging, which is below standard for a heritage property. When we tried to turn on the TV, we found out that the set top box was faulty. The housekeeping staff tried to fix the TV for half an hour but finally said sorry and left. Then our wifi was also not working so we complained to the reception twice but still we did not get any help. Our booking was for 2 days but we immediately cancelled our bookings for the next day and booked in another hotel. Because there is no point in staying where guests' comfort is not taken care of. Decor and food was good. Otherwise service needs improvement.\nSo our stay at Umaid Bhawan Royal Style Heritage Boutique Hotel was nothing special.",

The interval room is quite quite beautiful where they greet you with a drink. The area by the pool is relaxing also with three cabanas and the service friendly and lovely. The pool is a delightful space. Sunbeds facing the garden are best. The gym is modern and has a nice aspect in an air conditioned glazed balcony overlooking the pool. Our room, 118 was super large and comfortable. Housekeeping and laundry were impeccable quick and polite. Food at the restaurant was delicious - from the breakfast dhosas, bhurji to the evening tikka / tandoori chicken with delicious breads and jeers or veg rice and amazing vegetable dishes.\nService was impeccable through out. The courtyard was cool enough in August for us to eat outside in the evening but the restaurant room is glorious as is the winter bar next to it which is stunning. Casting around for an issue the only one I could find was that I went to get our bags on arrival as I wanted a swim and they took a while to arrive. In other words Samode Haveli is near perfect. We had a lovely stay in the Oberoi in Agra and were wondering if we should\u2019ve gone to them in Jaipur - Samode was by far the better choice with atmospheric and beautiful settings and top service. Loved it.",

We had mentioned that it was my father\u2019s birthday, and to our surprise, they went above and beyond by upgrading our stay and making the entire day incredibly special for him and for all of us.\n\nEvery detail, from the warm greetings to the thoughtful gestures, reflected genuine care and world-class service. The resort itself is stunning, but it\u2019s the people who truly make it magical.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to the manager and every member of the team for creating such a memorable experience. We left with full hearts and beautiful memories, and we can\u2019t wait to visit again!",

The housekeeping staff did a great job in providing comfort and hygiene.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the hospitality of the staff. Every encounter whether it was from the front desk staff to restaurant service was friendly, attentive, and made me feel truly cared for. They were always willing to assist with a smile.\n\nThe cuisine was also a highlight. The spread during the buffet featured a range of dishes, both international and local, and every meal was fresh and delicious. Watching the sunset view from the rooftop in the evening is not to be missed , it provides an added special touch to the experience.\n\nOverall, Hilton Jaipur provides the ideal combination of luxury, comfort, and hospitality.

One of the areas we absolutely loved was the pool area, which is very relaxing and complete with a seating space and a separate area for lounge chairs.\nThe service was absolutely impeccable! We were very well taken care of, and the staff was always around to ask us if we needed anything or make changes to accommodate all the guests. One thing that can be improved though is their buffet menu, which I felt was lacking variety. The breakfast buffet was nice, with ample choices of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The lunch buffet, however, could be improved.\nOverall, we had a nice stay and would definitely recommend it to friends and family!",

Every single staff member here goes out of their way in making sure you do not as much as lift a single finger. We are staying in the room with the private garden and it is such a lovely concept. The room itself is gorgeous, the bathroom is stunning and the deep sinking tub very luxurious. This hotel  is an embodiment of an ultra pampered, idyllic Indian summer getaway. We stayed here with our little kids and every single member of the staff made sure to talk to our kids in the utmost sweet manner and made their day. When we arrived they had adorable snack plates waiting for the kids in our room with their names written on each! The highlight of the trip was custom embroidered cushions with the kids names on them waiting when we reached our room after dinner at the hotel restaurant!\nThey showered us all little goodies and momentous all through our stay. We didn\u2019t feel the need to step out at all they have cultural performance every evening done very tastefully. The true meaning of a luxury hotel is really not in its rooms, infrastructure or offerings but in the staff and how they make you feel - n every member of the staff here willl treat you like royalty! We live 3 hours away and will be sure to return very very soon! Thank you Oberoi Rajvilas you have redefined the meaning of a luxury hotel for us!",

            "text": "From the moment my mother and I arrived at the RAAS Rajmahal Palace on the 8th of December 2024, we were swept off our feet by the sheer grandeur and charm of this heritage property. Nestled in the heart of Jaipur, this beautifully preserved colonial palace truly encapsulates the essence of royal Rajasthan.\n\nOne of the highlights of our stay was undoubtedly the exceptional hospitality of the staff, particularly Vishal. His unwavering friendliness, attentiveness, and dedication elevated our experience to unparalleled levels of comfort and satisfaction. It is rare to encounter such impeccable service, and Vishal's warmth left an indelible impression on us, cementing RAAS Rajmahal as my ONLY choice for accommodation in Jaipur for all future visits.\n\nThe interiors of the palace are a feast for the senses, blending colonial elegance with a touch of regal opulence. Every corner of the property seemed to tell a story, with intricate designs, rich textiles, and tasteful decor that transport you back in time.\n\nThe culinary experience was equally stellar. The a la carte breakfast buffet was a delightful journey for our taste buds. Each dish was expertly crafted and brimming with flavor, offering a perfect start to our day. The attention to detail in presentation and taste was remarkable, and the service during breakfast was, as expected, impeccable.\n\nAnother standout moment of our stay was the gracious offer to upgrade to one of their exquisite suites, which I accepted without hesitation. The suite was nothing short of spectacular, with spacious, thoughtfully designed interiors and an ambiance that perfectly balanced luxury and comfort. It provided us with a sanctuary where we could unwind and soak in the royal treatment.\n\nEverything about our stay was flawless, from the beautiful surroundings to the world-class service. The RAAS Rajmahal Palace is not just a hotel; it is an experience, a destination in itself. I cannot recommend it enough to anyone visiting Jaipur.\n\nIn summary, our stay was a royal affair filled with luxury, warmth, and unforgettable memories. Thank you to Vishal and the entire team at RAAS Rajmahal Palace for making our time there so special. We will undoubtedly return, time and time again.",

The service here was impeccable-beyond any other hotel I have ever stayed in.  I felt like royalty staying here and so comfortable.  The room itself was designed beautifully and well appointed.  Extremely luxurious feel & old world charm.  I adored how they offered a complementary tour of the palace where you were able to learn about history of the palace and the beautiful Queen who lived their as well as they offered carriage horse rides & entertainment at night that was so fun! I was able to dance to Rajastani music with professional awesome dancers and marveled at the experience, as an American, just loved it.  The music was so serene.  I also had an experience at the spa and thoroughly enjoyed my massage/facial\u2014amazing and not as expensive as one would think!  This hotel also had superb dining\u2014we tried each restaurant and none of the food disappointed.  Cinnamon was especially good & their breakfast buffet outstanding.  Also, this hotel was in a great location to so sightseeing, we were all over Jaipur touring and it was the perfect base.  Plus, the pool was a nice touch, but I didn\u2019t use it - was a bit cold.\nThe property itself was also so alluring and well maintained-you can just enjoy a stroll around and there were even peacocks walking around and other beautiful birds!  Two stores on the property as well and ended up buying a beautiful ring at one of them for my mother in law.  Opal & diamonds- excellent quality!  They had another store with lots of antique paintings also which was fun to explore & admire the art.  Definitely stay here if you appreciate the charms of a historic palace!!!!! You will love it.",

The room itself was spacious, elegant and beautifully decorated, with all the modern amenities one could need. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and I slept soundly every night of my stay.\n\nThe hotel also boasts several excellent dining options, each serving delicious food that showcased the best of Indian and international cuisine. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive, with a wide range of options that catered to all tastes.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay at The Raj Palace was the fantastic spa, where I indulged in a range of rejuvenating treatments that left me feeling relaxed and refreshed. The pool area was also a great place to unwind and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.\n\nThe hotel also offers a range of facilities for business travelers, including several conference rooms and a well-equipped business center.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend The Raj Palace enough.

A delicious cake and a bottle of wine were waiting in our room, which made our experience even more special.\n\nThe absolute highlight of our visit was the cooking class with the Barli family and Chef Govind. It was a unique evening filled with warmth, cultural exchange, and wonderful insights into authentic local recipes.\n\nDileep Kothi is a true oasis of peace in the heart of bustling Jaipur.

It delivers an opulent and modern experience that blends traditional Rajasthani charm with contemporary comforts. As soon as you enter, you feel like you're in one of those Udaipur palaces-turned-hotels. That's because the hotel has been a decade in the making, thanks to the manual stone-carving. A bunch of giant crystal chandeliers hover above you in the lobby. The owners spared no expense and employed the finest artisans from across the region(and the finest marbles and stones from across the state) to lay out every nook and corner of the property. Most importantly, the decor and architecture of the Suite we stayed in was so tastefully done it felt like we were staying in a real palace accommodation!  While Rajasthan is known for hospitality the the staff at this Hyatt took it to a whole new level making it deserve a 7-star rating, well about the 5-star tag it has.\n\nLOCATION: Situated in the Mansarovar area, the hotel is a bit removed from the central attractions of Jaipur, such as the City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and the bustling markets of the Pink City. Nonetheless, the location offers a peaceful retreat from the city's hustle and bustle, but it may not be ideal for those looking to explore the main tourist spots frequently.\n\nDINE + DRINK: The dining options at the Hyatt Regency Mansarovar are a highlight, with multiple restaurants offering a variety of cuisines.  The breakfast was an indulgent affair offering a multi-cuisine buffet with the specialty Rajasthani dishes receiving high marks. The main restaurant offers a wonderful array of fine local cuisine whipped up by highly skilled chefs!\n\nROOM: We stayed in Room 1011,which was a ROYAL DIPLOMAT SUITE;  SIZE: A huge Living Room with a much bigger Bedroom both tastefully decked up with local rajasthani craftsmanship and artwork. A marvelous experience staying amidst this. VIEW: View of the huge courtyard from the sitout outside the room; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting us to sleep; BATHROOM:Huge luxurious bathroom designed like a Royal place of bathing with a Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Wonderful Spa quality toiletries\n\nFACILITIES: Another big highlight of the place were the recreational and health facilities. An excellent gym loaded with the state of the art fitness equipment and weights. A lovely outdoor swimming pool to soak yourself in the evening. And there is also a great Spa on site\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of. Special Shout-out to KARISHMA from the front office who provided us with a warm welcome experience along with her team (including DHANANJAY). Big thanks to YUVRAJ and JANVI from the Restaurant section for hosting us like family and in fact fattening us by indulging us with decadently delicious food! JITENDRA from the breakfast for attending to all our needs.\n\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi that works well all over the property, and the speed is good!

The seamless check-in and check-out process further underscored the hotel\u2019s commitment to providing top-notch service.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the amazing spa.

The spa menu offers a variety of treatments, and the skilled therapists tailored their techniques to ensure maximum comfort and rejuvenation. After a long day of work, the spa was the perfect retreat to unwind and recharge.\n\nThe culinary experience at Novotel Jaipur was equally impressive. The on-site restaurant serves a delectable array of dishes that cater to a variety of palates. Each meal was a delightful journey of flavours, showcasing both local Rajasthani cuisine and international favourites. The breakfast buffet was a particular standout, with an extensive selection of fresh, delicious options to start the day right. The restaurant staff were attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the dining experience with their professionalism and warmth.\n\nThe Novotel Jaipur Convention Centre offers an unparalleled blend of luxurious accommodations, exceptional guest services, and outstanding amenities.
