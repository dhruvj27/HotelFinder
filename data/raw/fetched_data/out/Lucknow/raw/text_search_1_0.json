Whether it was a simple request like a Band-Aid or anything else, nothing came without repeated calls.\n\nOne evening it was raining heavily and no Ola/Uber was available. I was just 850 meters away and requested the hotel to help with a pickup. They refused, giving excuses, which was surprising for a brand like Hilton.\n\nDuring dining, the staff seemed more focused on reminding guests to pay the bill rather than offering a warm dining experience. At least four staff members came, one after the other, just to remind me to settle the bill. No one even asked how the food was.\n\nAt check-out, I politely asked if I could go back to the room for a quick change of clothes, or if they could provide a small space. The response was a blunt \u201cyou can use the restroom, no other place will be allowed.\u201d Not something you'd expect from a hospitality-first brand.\n\nWhile the property itself is well-maintained, the staff attitude and service levels need serious improvement. I truly hope the management addresses these issues so future guests have a better experience.",

On August 12th, around 22:35, I dined at your evening buffet and was served Chicken Malai. Unfortunately, upon inspecting the dish, I found a hair in it. I immediately brought this to the attention of the Floor Chef and Duty Manager, who took the issue seriously and apologized for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Chef and Duty Manager offered to replace the dish, but given the nature of the issue, I decided not to continue with my meal. As a guest, it's unsettling to encounter such an incident, and it raises questions about the quality control measures in place.\n\nFurthermore, I had a similar experience the previous day when I requested your floor team to send some fresh dishes from the buffet to my room as I returned late from a site visit. To my surprise, I received leftover food from the buffet, which was not what I had requested. This incident not only raised concerns about food handling but also made me question whether the hotel was prioritizing cost savings over serving fresh food to guests.\n\nWhile I appreciate the prompt response from the Chef and Duty Manager regarding the hair incident, these experiences collectively raise concerns about the overall food safety and hygiene standards at your hotel. I understand that mistakes can happen, but I hope you'll take this feedback constructively and review your quality control processes to ensure the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.\n\nI hope that you will take my feedback seriously and take necessary actions to address these concerns. I look forward to hearing from you and seeing improvements in your Service.",

They didn\u2019t even allow me to sit in the waiting area, as if I was some outsider and not a paying guest!\n\n2. My phone battery was about to die, and I politely requested to charge it for just 10 minutes at the reception. A staff member named Jitender Kumar flat-out refused, saying it's against hotel rules. Seriously? Which decent hotel denies such a basic request?\n\nThis place treats guests like a burden rather than customers. The staff is rude, the management is pathetic, and the policies are absurd. If you\u2019re looking for a horrible experience filled with inconvenience and frustration, then go ahead and book this hotel. Otherwise, STAY AWAY!",

We had booked 1  room here as our father was admitted in Medanta for a surgery and only 1 attendant could stay at Medanta. The price is a bit on the higher side, but i will say it is worth it. The rooms were spacious with a small fridge, electric kettle, good lighting,  a window and a bath with all toiletries. The best part of the Hotel is the restaurant (The Clove). They also have a bar menu.   The prices are again a bit higher. However,  the  taste, quality and  portion of food was just vow! We tried South Indian, English breakfast, North Indian, Thai and every food had its unique taste.\n\n1 recommendation - they can improve their wifi because sometimes the internet browsing speed will fall drastically.\n\nOverall, we had a very comfortable stay.!",

            "text": "This hotel is one of the best hotels near Lulu Mall and Medanta Hospital. We had booked 1  room here as our father was admitted in Medanta for a surgery and only 1 attendant could stay at Medanta. The price is a bit on the higher side, but i will say it is worth it. The rooms were spacious with a small fridge, electric kettle, good lighting,  a window and a bath with all toiletries. The best part of the Hotel is the restaurant (The Clove). They also have a bar menu.   The prices are again a bit higher. However,  the  taste, quality and  portion of food was just vow! We tried South Indian, English breakfast, North Indian, Thai and every food had its unique taste.\n\n1 recommendation - they can improve their wifi because sometimes the internet browsing speed will fall drastically.\n\nOverall, we had a very comfortable stay.!",

The service was impeccable, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the rooms were spacious and comfortable.\nThe rooms had all the amenities I needed, such as a TV, a fridge, a coffee maker, and a safe. The beds were cozy and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked with toiletries.\n\nThe hotel has a very nice breakfast buffet with a variety of dishes to suit every taste. There were fresh fruits, juices, and pastries. The restaurant on the top floor has a great view of the city and the Ambedkar Park, which is just a short walk away.\nThe park is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the architecture.  It has a large statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, and a museum dedicated to his life and work.\n\nThe hotel is also close to other attractions and shopping centers, such as the Bara Imambara, the Rumi Darwaza, and the Hazratganj market.
