From the warm welcome at check-in to the attentive service throughout my stay, everything was handled with great professionalism and care.

I would especially like to thank Shafugta from the Guest Relations team for her exceptional support. Her thoughtful assistance and kind demeanor truly made a difference and added a personal touch to my stay. She was always approachable and ensured that all my needs were met promptly and graciously.

The highlight was definitely the restaurant service. The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The team ensured quick service with a warm smile, which made the dining experience even more enjoyable. The breakfast spread had great variety, and the dinner was truly memorable.

mum003,mum003_r3,katyayani dalmia,2,"I stayed at this Hilton property for one night on the 8th of May with my husband and child- overall, the experience was disappointing and caught me by surprise.
The ""city view"" room was dark and depressing -from the window we could see the side of another building and some construction- should more properly be classified as ""no view"" so that visitors come with the right expectation. It was clean, but overpriced for what it was.
Secondly, the buffet dinner at the Brasserie had a very limited menu, at a price point for which you can get far more in this city. It only makes sense for corporate travellers who are not paying out of pocket, and indeed, most of the guests  we saw dining around us seemed to fit this category. The breakfast was good.
I will commend the staff for their hospitality and helpfulness, from the front desk to the restaurant.
The location is good for the airport, but next time I would choose from one of the many other options around. Overall, disappointing and overpriced for what it was, and not the standard of Hilton.",2025-08-25T11:59:43.739721913Z,a week ago

I stayed at the Hilton Hotel for one day during a work trip, and I had a truly pleasant experience. I would especially like to appreciate Chris Borges from the in-room dining service for his outstanding hospitality.

Chris Borges went above and beyond his service was prompt, professional, and very courteous. Along with delivering my order with care, he also gave his time to guide me about some nearby tourist attractions, which added a personal touch to my short stay. Despite being in town for work, I was able to explore a few local spots thanks to his helpful recommendations.

The location is truly stunning, offering breathtaking views of the Arabian Sea and the iconic Worli Sea Link. Our room was incredibly spacious and well-appointed with all the luxury amenities one could desire. The staff were consistently polite and provided top-notch hospitality throughout our stay.

What truly stood out was the beautifully designed kids' area. The inclusion of the small rabbit enclosure, fish pond, and bird area was a unique and delightful touch that our children absolutely loved. It created a wonderful atmosphere for them.

mum004,mum004_r4,Lakshminarayan Rbalan,3,"I had a not so good experience during my stay from 29th to 30th June 2025 (Sunday & Monday). I had booked 2 rooms and asked for an early Check in. I reached the Hotel by 1pm. I was given one room around 2pm which was a twin bed, while I had booked for a King bed. My family was sitting in the allotted room for almost 2 hours uncomfortably. After much follow up, I was given one room with king bed and had again to wait for another room for a while. Finally I got second room around 3.45 pm.I had plans to take rest and go for a swim in the pool, but because of the delayed check in, all my plans went for a toss. One of the rooms allotted had an uncleaned window therby obstructing the sea view for which I had specifically booked.

Next day morning, for breakfast at 9.30 am, there were 15 people waiting in the line outside the restaurant. We were asked to go to the other restaurant below. I had asked for a table for 5 which was given with 5 chairs and  only 4 table mats. Had to again wait for sometime requesting them to put the mat and the cutlery. Most of the food items were not even warm. Taste was just so so. Had to wait for bowls for sambar.

Overall, our high expectations of a great weekend at a reputed hotel was not satisfactory.",2025-07-02T10:49:38.433999999Z,2 months ago

The starters were limited and didn’t match the standards expected from a 5-star property, and the main course was similarly underwhelming.

mum006,mum006_r2,Anu Mishra,1,"I’m currently staying at Hotel Lalit and unfortunately, the experience so far has been far from what one expects from a so-called 5-star property. The service has been consistently poor — dialing ‘0’ for assistance goes unanswered, the front desk is uninterested and slow, and overall responsiveness is lacking.

One of the restaurants was entirely empty, with no staff in sight. I had to physically walk over to an adjacent space to find someone to serve. The soda was served warm, and when questioned, staff candidly admitted that cost-cutting measures were the reason behind such lapses. And did nothing about it! It was evident they were not expecting guests, which is alarming for any hospitality business, let alone one advertising itself as a premium hotel.

The furniture feels dated, and while the bathrooms are acceptable, nothing about the property justifies a 5-star rating. If this hotel had claimed to be a 3-star, I wouldn’t have felt compelled to leave a review — my expectations would have been set accordingly. But this level of service and preparedness is simply misleading and unacceptable under a 5-star banner. In the age of digital bookings, we rely on pictures and rating to make our decisions.

That said, I do feel for the staff trying to make do in an environment clearly hampered by underinvestment and poor management decisions. The issue here isn’t their intent, but a system that leaves them unsupported and guests disappointed.

Would not recommend unless major improvements are made — or unless you’re booking with 3-star (or 2.5) expectations.",2025-07-21T23:16:08.926807889Z,a month ago
mum006,mum006_r3,Amisha Patel,3,"We recently stayed at The Lalit Mumbai and, unfortunately, it fell short of expectations. While it may have once been a 5-star property, it no longer feels like one.

The rooms are quite outdated, and the bathroom was particularly concerning — there was visible pink slime in the shower and around the sink, which suggests bacterial growth (likely pseudomonas). It makes you question whether proper cleaning agents like bleach are being used by housekeeping.

I booked a room for two adults and a child via Booking.com, clearly mentioning all specifications, yet was unexpectedly charged extra upon check-in. The front desk staff were unwelcoming and not helpful at all, which left a sour first impression.

On a positive note, the concierge team was excellent — helpful, professional, and truly the highlight of our experience in terms of service.

We arrived late around 11pm and opted for room service. Unfortunately, the food was cold, and no condiments were provided with our side of fries. The egg sandwich, spaghetti, and paneer dish were all underwhelming in terms of quality and presentation.

During checkout, I overheard another guest also voicing complaints, which confirmed that our experience wasn’t isolated.

Overall, this hotel seems more deserving of a 3-star rating at most. It’s disappointing to see how much it has declined. For the premium prices charged, guests should expect much better standards across the board",2025-04-22T09:50:25.741211Z,4 months ago

This is my first detailed review, and it’s going to be a long one — but that’s because my experience with JW Marriott was truly exceptional.

From the moment we arrived, everything about the hotel impressed us — the location, the ambiance, and the attention to detail in every nook and corner. I especially want to highlight the Sauna and the Breakfast Buffet, both of which were absolutely top-notch.

However, this review isn’t just about the facilities.

What truly stood out was the incredible service during a time of need. During our stay, my wife fell ill, and I had a flight scheduled for 9:00 PM. I requested a late check-out to accommodate her rest and recovery — and the hotel graciously agreed without hesitation. This small gesture made a huge difference to us, and I am extremely thankful for the compassion and flexibility they showed.

A special thanks to Andrez, Jivanth, and Lalit — your professionalism and kindness did not go unnoticed. You truly represent the best of Marriott’s values.

Special Mention to Martin

mum007,mum007_r5,Madhusudan Ladda,4,"JW Marriott Juhu has been one of my favourite stays in the past — I’ve had a full sea view room before, and the experience was truly top-notch. That’s why I chose it again for a special celebration — our birthday and anniversary stay.

This time, I booked over a phone call and clearly mentioned our wish for a full sea view room. Unfortunately, the staff didn’t communicate the room details properly. We ended up with a partial view, and worse — the window was dirty, making the view even less enjoyable. Despite informing the reception, no action was taken, which was disappointing for a returning guest on a special occasion.

That said, there were some clear highlights:
•	The spa was exceptional — from the sauna, steam, cold bath, whirlpool jacuzzi, to the relaxation room, everything was serene, clean, and truly therapeutic. The staff there deserves appreciation for their warm and attentive service.
•	The swimming pool was another plus — especially the saltwater pool, which was a refreshing and unique experience.
•	The breakfast spread was fantastic — a great mix of Indian and international options, fresh fruits, juices, live counters, and excellent coffee. A perfect start to the morning.

Overall, while parts of the stay were memorable, the room experience and lack of proactive service left us a little let down — especially as returning guests celebrating something personal. Still, the property has its charm, and hopefully, with better communication, future stays can be closer to the standard we once loved.",2025-07-08T11:19:08.038086975Z,a month ago

mum008,mum008_r5,Taronish Mullan,5,"Beautiful Hotel at a lovely location. Enjoyed the weekend of Independence day.
We did the booking directly with Taj. They were so helpful from the start,, Rohit the Asst Manager took care of all our needs specially for my old parents who needed a room for specially abled.
Check in process was smooth and perfect. Jasmeet had contacted us before our check in and made lovely decorations for our celebration of 85th Birthday as well as for Anniversary. Jasmeet said she was our one point contact for all our needs but unfortunately after we checked in she hardly responded to our queries.
We had booked 4 rooms. We had 2 pool facing rooms as those are the only ones for the specially abled people and 2 Mangrove view rooms which have an excellent view. You must choose mangrove view. Prachi did a very smooth check in for all our rooms.
The rooms are large and the bathroom has all ammentites. The Bathroom is designed so well that has a bath tub and separate enclosure for Toilet and bathroom.
The Houskeeping staff was very prompt. Specially Harshali who always attended to our requirements and she cleaned the rooms perfectly. Was very impressive.
The in room dining attended to all our needs and services but the timeline for serving should be improved as we had to call many times.
The hotel had made lovely arrangements for Independence day celebrations. They had tea coffee and snacks in the lobby with classical dance and music. They even had sweet dish plate in our rooms.
The Breakfast at  Shamiana was superb. The spread was fabulous with so much variety for Veg and Non veg. There were so many options in live counter for dosas, eggs, pancakes, parathas, puris, french toast etc. Maybe one day would love to drive down just for breakfast.
Maybe one improvement can be made is to have a small play area for kids which we missed.
The ground level also has banquet rooms and ballroom. This will be good for destination wedding or corporate events.
Another beautiful highlight we saw was the way the hotel security lowered the flag after sunset and completed the formality with respect. The true way to do it even when nobody is watching. Was very proud of Taj Trees",2025-08-17T14:49:01.185001209Z,2 weeks ago

The staff have truly mastered the art of ignoring guests with Olympic-level commitment. Smiles? Nonexistent. Helpfulness? Laughable. Hospitality? Must’ve gotten lost on the way here.
In-room dining? A joke. You’ll call. No one answers. Call again—still nothing. If by some miracle someone does pick up, don’t get too excited. That’s just the beginning of your slow descent into starvation. You could order dinner and still have time to write your will before it arrives. Maybe.
The only thing impressive here is how proudly they deliver such consistent disrespect. No warmth, no urgency, no care—just vibes and a strong sense that you’re bothering them by existing.
Clean rooms? Yes. But clean doesn’t cancel out crap service.
Would I come back? I’d rather eat cardboard in a bus station.",2025-07-16T07:20:15.011261972Z,a month ago
mum009,mum009_r2,Sanjjeev A Mohanty,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Lemon Tree Premier Hotel, Mumbai is one of the best properties to stay in the city, especially if you’re looking for comfort and convenience near the airport. The location is excellent – just a few minutes away from Mumbai International Airport, which is perfect for business travelers or those with early/late flights.

Rooms are spacious, clean, and modern, offering great comfort and amenities. The staff is polite and service is prompt. The hotel maintains good hygiene standards and has a warm, welcoming vibe.

Rates usually range between ₹7,000–₹8,000 per night including breakfast, which is quite reasonable for the quality offered. The breakfast spread is nice with a decent variety of Indian and continental options.

Overall, a great value-for-money hotel with everything you need for a comfortable and stress-free stay in Mumbai. Highly recommended!",2025-06-25T07:25:55.485619015Z,2 months ago

This is the second time I am facing an issue with the staffs the first time it was a girl who was in IRD and this time the staff name called Nida at the front desk  . I didn’t liked her behaviour. She was rude when I was being nice . She could have said it in a better way. Which made the stay quite unpleasant. Would not recommend unless staff training improves. Hospitality is key in the hotel industry, I hope improvements are made in staff training and attitude. Thank you",2025-08-23T06:37:55.446694766Z,2 weeks ago

Unfortunately, repairs were taking place during peak hours, which made the constant noise quite unwelcoming.
However, the staff truly deserves a five-star rating for their outstanding service. The food is exceptional; we had the pleasure of dining at Goma and enjoying the breakfast brunch at Musafir, and the quality was consistently impressive. A huge shoutout to Chef Vaibhav Gawad and his team!

The breakfast spread and overall food quality are outstanding—an absolute delight for the palate. What stood out most was the staff—extremely courteous, cooperative, and always ready to assist, with warm smiles that make you feel genuinely welcome.

Its proximity to the airport makes it an excellent choice for transit or business travelers, although do note that the surrounding locality doesn’t offer much in terms of entertainment or dining options.

I spent two days here with my sons and overall, our experience was very pleasant. However, I would like to bring one matter to the management’s attention. My 12-year-old son, an aspiring photographer, was carrying his professional camera as he had planned some photography work in Mumbai. While entering the hotel lobby, he was unexpectedly questioned about why he had a camera and was told it wasn’t allowed. I was quite taken aback by this interaction—it's surprising and disheartening to see a young student’s passion being questioned in such a setting.

Apart from this one incident, everything else about the stay was impeccable. I hope the management reflects on this for future guest experiences, especially when it involves children and their creativity.",2025-07-15T15:57:57.006913309Z,a month ago

mum011,mum011_r3,Rashmi Bangar,5,"Review for ITC Maratha – A Truly Memorable and Comfortable Stay

I recently had the pleasure of staying at ITC Maratha while accompanying my husband on his business trip, and I must say, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.

Right from the moment we arrived, the hospitality and warmth shown by the staff made us feel at home. The rooms were beautifully maintained and offered the perfect balance of comfort and luxury.

A special mention to Chef Patil ji, who greeted us every morning at breakfast with a warm smile and a spread of absolutely delicious food. His personal touch and attention to our preferences made every breakfast feel special and homely. It was such a delightful way to start the day!

Another big thank you to Pushpalata ji from the room service team, who took great care in keeping our room just the way we liked it. She was always polite, attentive, and ensured that every little detail was taken care of, which truly enhanced our comfort.

What touched us the most was the way ITC Maratha made my husband's birthday extra special. We were pleasantly surprised with a beautifully arranged cake, a bouquet of fresh flowers, and a lovely fruit basket waiting in our room. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made the day truly memorable for both of us.

Thank you, ITC Maratha, for a stay filled with warmth, care, and thoughtful touches. We’ll always remember this experience fondly and look forward to visiting again!",2025-04-17T07:15:34.662112Z,4 months ago

Service was probably too slow or were not efficient due to hotel being fully over booked hence the rush of guest was too much for them to handle. Check-in was bit slow and had a long queue and so was the same on check out.
Had to ask for high chair of the baby for probably 6 to 7 times still unresponsive. Food was decent enough nothing too be so much to be praised off. The rooms were over booked due to glitch and hence they provided me with free upgrade which we appreciated a lot and probably that made for everything that they goofed up for. Stay was wonderful and warm with large rooms and beautiful space.",2025-08-07T17:59:57.386852343Z,4 weeks ago

One of the standout features is its heritage architecture, preserving the charm and elegance of the colonial era, which adds a unique and pleasant atmosphere to the stay.

mum012,mum012_r2,Kanushree Jain,5,"Truly A GEM! One of the best 5 star hotels near the airport that actually maintain 5 star standards while still being more affordable than others. This is a newer property with several Instagrammable spots like their pool and garden. Reception attends to you immediately and Nilesh in particular is very helpful when it comes to reservations and any adjustments that may be needed. The rooms are well designed and love that the shower has a door and a high divider so water doesn’t spill out when taking a shower. Breakfast is a FULL LUXURY experience with endless options catering to multicultural taste palettes and each item is authentically cooked. Dee in the breakfast area is super kind and helpful and honestly goes above to offer any assistance needed. I really appreciated that the breakfast staff allowed me to take breakfast to my room while I was unwell so I could eat at a slower pace. Housekeeping is PHENOMENAL…they tidy and clean your room as meticulously as shown in the book, “The Girl with a Pearl Earring” where it’s cleaned while keeping your things as you would want to find them. A small suggestion for improvement would be consistent temperature across different spaces and perhaps a bit more attention to non spicy food requirements by in room dining which was fixed immediately after mentioned. Overall, I truly enjoyed my stay and would recommend to everyone! The staff here really does an incredible job to make the stay as wonderful as possible for each guest.

The bar and restaurant were all closed on a Friday night, and there wasn't anywhere suggested that we could even sit and have a drink together before bed.

mum012,mum012_r5,Pallavi Bothra,5,"It’s a five-star hotel, so I’ll skip the basics.

What truly stood out for me was their buffet breakfast—an absolute favourite. The spread featured a great variety of cuisines, with frequent changes that kept things exciting and fresh. Extra points for a separate gluten free section which included bread, cake and a few other things.

Special mention to the staff, Aarti and Sonal—I stayed for 10 days, and every single morning, I made it a point to start my day there. A healthy breakfast, a happy tummy, warm and welcoming people, and a beautiful green space—it all came together to give my day the perfect start.

Few feedbacks:
1. The naturally GF items (boiled eggs, sausages) are kept on a wheat chapati to keep it soft - contaminating it with gluten. Can be changed.
2. Can make seeds (chia, pumpkin, sunflower) a regular feature instead of once in a week",2025-04-18T15:03:14.512004Z,4 months ago
mum013,mum013_r1,Monika More,2,"I had expected a far better experience from a property that claims to be a five-star hotel, but unfortunately, my stay left much to be desired.

I had requested a room change shortly after check-in due to the unpleasant view from the window — the first thing visible was a dumped garbage area, which had become even worse and mucky due to rain. It was not only unpleasant to look at but also affected the overall feel of the room. Additionally, since the room was on a lower floor facing another building, we had to keep our curtains closed all the time to maintain privacy — which completely defeated the purpose of a relaxing, well-lit room.

I spoke with a representative over the phone who assured me that the team would call me back regarding the room change — no one ever did. I also raised the issue at the reception counter and while the staff there was willing to help, by then half of my stay was already over, making the change pointless.

Another concern was the food pricing and quantity. While I understand and accept premium pricing at such properties, the portion sizes were surprisingly small — not sufficient even for two people. If the prices are on the higher end, then the quantity should justify it.

Overall, apart from the entrance and lobby area which gives a five-star impression, the rest of the experience did not live up to the standards one would expect from such a property. Basic guest comfort and proactive service were clearly lacking.

I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on addressing these issues — both in terms of room allocation transparency and service responsiveness.",2025-07-01T07:32:26.084520422Z,2 months ago

The breakfast is also average and so are the other facilities, swimming pool is also average and not so great. The lifts were smelling with some smoking like smell, the staff was rarely smiling and seems to be least bothered.
Overall experience is a kind of 2/5 star, don't expect any feel of a luxury hotel and expect a slightly upper than the normal budget hotel, as the Novotel Brand may sound very luxury but this property is no where close to its standards.",2025-08-21T04:26:44.352215515Z,2 weeks ago

Considering the hotel of this stature we expected the lost and found/hotel management to have promptly acted on the request. But it was never found and neither were we informed till we called back again after an hour and a half.
We later found out that the reception had also not informed housekeeping about the exact location of the lost item (beside table)
Not shifting blame - totally admit that leaving something behind was our fault. Low rating to reflect that we expected better from this hotel. Even if it was a prompt call to convey to us that they did not find the lost item - given it was expensive.",2025-07-26T00:10:34.847051864Z,a month ago

mum017,mum017_r4,Arian Soni,2,"I recently stayed at The Leela Mumbai, and while the property is stunning and well-maintained, a few things left me thinking twice before I book again.

✅ What stood out (and deserves applause):
•	Citrus – Breakfast Buffet: Exceptional. The spread, freshness, and flavors were top-tier. A must-experience.
•	Cleanliness & Amenities: Rooms were spotless, beds comfortable, and all amenities including spa, sauna, and swimming pool were well-managed and relaxing.
•	Location: You really can’t beat it — central, premium, and peaceful.
•	Special Mention: Paaji (Doorman/Host): A true gem! Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That’s the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.

❌ Where things fell flat:
•	Customer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival — but received no response, and none of the requests were honored.
•	Check-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch. It felt like we were just another room number to him — not the Leela standard at all.
•	Room Allocation: The main reason I booked Leela was for the view over the swimming pool, and it wasn’t provided even after communicating it in advance.

⚖️ Final Thoughts:

The property is absolutely worth experiencing — beautiful interiors, relaxing amenities, and standout hospitality by individuals like Paaji.
But the front desk team and guest communication need serious improvement if The Leela wants to continue being a name that stands for luxury.

Will I return? Maybe — but I’ll think twice, and only after ensuring better pre-arrival communication.",2025-08-05T17:14:53.691547724Z,a month ago

mum021,mum021_r4,Michelle de Souza,1,"I had work in Worli for a day and looked for a hotel to stay near by to the location of work. I came across Bloom Hotel on Google and checked the reviews and room images. From my understanding the room images look like they were taken at the time the hotel was just established. Cause I realised after we arrived there, that the rooms were not maintained and looked old. The reception and corridors have a bad odour. I had breakfast include in my booking which we decided to skip, as we just wanted to leave the establishment as quickly as possible.

I regret not putting in a few more thousands for a room in a better hotel. If I have to compare this three star hotel to other three star hotels like Tata’s Ginger, then Ginger is a ‘five star’ compared to the room we stayed in at the Bloom Hotel, for a much cheaper rate.

The AC only functioned at one slow speed, even putting it on the ‘turbo’ setting made no change in the fan speed and cooling, my guesses are is that the AC is rigged. There is also no elevator. And only one pair of room slippers for two guests in a queen room.

I’m not sure about the positive reviews I’ve seen here on Google, because to me, it feels like those guests stayed at a completely different hotel. I feel duped into believing them, which led me to make this booking.

To the hotel owner: Please take this opportunity (“take this chance you are given”) to use your revenue for the upkeep of your hotel so it is in par with other hotels in the same grade.",2025-07-14T09:53:10.393259696Z,a month ago

First, my bathroom was full of mosquitoes since there was an opening hole for them. I always had to make sure that I didn't leave the light on there. The door to the bathroom also wasn't able to close fully, so they would also come into my sleeping room. But the worst thing in there was that at some daytime you could hear a bigger animal above the ceiling of the bathroom. I was always afraid a rat or something could crash in. However, I stayed because of budget reasons.

The next blow didn't wait for long. I felt a little bit sick after the first night with the aircon on. Didn't think much about it. But after the second night I was totally sick and needed to recover in that hotel room with no aircon since it obviously hadn't been cleaned and made people sick. I never had a problem with getting sick from an ac and have travelled over 9 months in tropical countries. The health issues clearly must have been from an uncleaned ac.

March 2025 Stay

Our first visit to Kemps Corner Hotel in March 2025 was a very pleasant one. We stayed for 7 days in a Luxury Queen category room, which was exceptionally spacious with a separate workstation that made our stay comfortable. The bathroom was nice, the staff was good and cooperative, and the terrace breakfast was a delightful experience. The overall atmosphere and weather were also enjoyable, making the stay truly comfortable and memorable.

August 2025 Stay

Unfortunately, our second stay in August 2025 was completely disappointing. The staff mistakenly kept my injections in a freezer instead of a refrigerator, which destroyed medicines worth about Rs. 35,000. Although the staff and manager apologized, no refund or compensation was offered for this serious negligence. The terrace breakfast was unpleasant due to the rainy weather, and the room allotted to us was much smaller than expected, even though we paid for the same Luxury Queen category. To make matters worse, the geyser was faulty — water from the shower was either scalding hot or ice cold, which made the stay very uncomfortable.

The lack of consistency in service and facilities, along with the handling of a costly mistake, turned what was once a pleasant experience into a highly disappointing one.",2025-08-26T08:41:32.314238891Z,a week ago
mum024,mum024_r2,Ashmita Shetty,1,"I recently stayed at this hotel and had an overall disappointing experience with the senior staff. While this is not my first time staying here and was actually quite impressed the last time. While the property and some of the support staff were good, the behavior and attitude of the main reception staff left a lot to be desired.

On the day of checkout, I specifically asked for help with my luggage as my cab was already waiting. Despite making the request directly, the reception staff showed no urgency or willingness to assist. Eventually, I had to carry everything down myself. Ironically, it was the watchman and a few helping staff who immediately offered to help — far more responsive and considerate than the ones who are actually in charge of guest service.

What was more frustrating was that the senior staff often approached guests with incorrect or half-verified information, which not only caused confusion but also came across as unprofessional. It’s not acceptable to disturb guests without first getting the facts right.

For a hotel that seems to pride itself on hospitality, the lack of basic courtesy, attentiveness, and professionalism from those at the front desk was disappointing. The management seriously needs to reconsider how its senior staff interact with guests — a little accuracy and respect would go a long way.",2025-07-31T05:26:51.296724948Z,a month ago

They were both very helpful and plainly, quite beautiful. I felt like India was a warm pool of kind sweetness. I must mention Pal who went out of his way several times to connect my internet. There was a glitch with my box and he worked tirelessly until he made it all better. The managers on both shifts were patient and professional, very helpful.

mum025,mum025_r2,Jessica Pringle,5,"Review: A Flawless Stay at the New Fairmont Mumbai – A True Masterpiece

From the moment we stepped into the Fairmont Mumbai, it was evident that this hotel is in a league of its own. The grandeur of the all–Art Deco design is breathtaking—timeless, sophisticated, and executed with precision in every detail. The caliber of the facilities is nothing short of extraordinary. From the rooms to the common spaces, every corner of the property exudes elegance and modern luxury. I simply could not be more positive about what this hotel has to offer.

What truly sets the Fairmont Mumbai apart, however, is the service and the culinary experience. The hospitality was unmatched—every interaction with the team felt warm, thoughtful, and refined. The staff were not only attentive, but intuitive, anticipating needs before they were even voiced. Their attention to detail and genuine commitment to guest satisfaction elevated the entire experience.

Each of the hotel's venues is a destination in itself. The tea room was serene and refined, offering a perfectly curated experience. The bar was stylish and vibrant, with an exceptional cocktail list and atmosphere to match. And the restaurants—plural, because each one is distinctly impressive—offered immense volume in terms of variety, flavour, and quality. The food was impeccable, showcasing culinary craftsmanship and an eye for presentation.

In every respect—design, service, cuisine, and ambiance—the Fairmont Mumbai delivers excellence. It is not just a new hotel; it is a new benchmark for luxury in India. An absolute triumph.",2025-08-01T02:30:41.878603862Z,a month ago

I had left a substantial sum in the locker, assumed it was taken, and even complained to the Director of Sales. The team investigated and proved it was safely untouched in the locker.

The croissant with Nutella & in-house ice cream was great!!

Until the management changed and now they have hiked up the price from everything or they were scamming me saying they have limited rooms but as soon as i said i didnt want it and argued with them to give me money they made it so difficultfor me and its nowhere written that there is a ""no refund"" policy they started saying that police checks our books and as soon as i mentioned that i will call police so they can help us sort this situation out in a calm manner the receptionist started becoming hostile and after all that hassle they gave me a room decent enough to justify what i was paying but toilet flush wouldnt work. I went to see the room and they were asking 2800 for a room which is supposedly deluxe. The rooms are horrible now and they are dirty. Totally not worth the price you pay for it. Rather pay 2k or 3k more and stay in a better room. Ever since Management changed I believe they just want to scam now I was so angry when I saw the room they were originally giving me cause I have stayed here before and for lesser I was given way better rooms. Absolutely worst experience. Toilet flush does not work AC is would work at times. I am sorry but I am never going to visit here ever again.

A perfect blend of luxury, elegance, and warm hospitality!
Aurika by Lemon Tree exceeded all expectations. From the moment you step in, the ambience feels grand and thoughtfully designed. The interiors are classy, the rooms are spacious, and every detail—from the linens to the lighting—reflects luxury.

What truly stands out is the exceptional service—the staff is courteous, attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile. The food is another highlight—beautifully presented and full of flavour, whether you’re enjoying a buffet breakfast or a quiet dinner.

The amenities, including the pool, spa, and fitness center, are well-maintained and add to the overall experience. Whether it’s a weekend getaway or a business stay, Aurika delivers comfort with style.

The rooms were spacious, spotless, and very comfortable. What really stood out was the service — professional, prompt, and warm. The hotel’s location is a big plus too, being very close to the airport, which made things much easier for me. They even offered convenient airport pick-up and drop-off services.

mum028,mum028_r3,Chirag Purohit,1,"Reason for very low rating is absolutely poor service received.

During check in I was advised that check in cannot be progressed as full payment had not been received for duration of stay from booking company I used to book.

I paid the booking company in full and at time I went to check in there was sufficient payment to cover one night's stay.

If Hotel does not trust booking company to receive full payment then this raises the obvious question on why Hotel are using booking company.

I was advised by staff at check in desk that as they are staff of Company they have to follow rules that Company has set. I then asked to speak with Manager to see if exception can be made. Duty Manager said to give Him ""2 mins"". He did not look into if exception can be made and was following up with booking company for full payment. After a long time i approached Manager for update and to my disappointment He was dealing with another enquiry and did not give any update to me before doing so.

When I raised my disappointment I was met with arrogant, rude remarks such as I should not be blaming Hotel and this is fault of booking company.

Above is not the only instance of arrogant, rude response from staff, as another instance is when I was over charged for drinks.

In this instance I bought drinks under ""buy one get one free"" promotion. Advert clearly showed promotion is buy one get one free.

When Bill came I saw I was charged for 2 drinks so buy one get one free was not applied.

When raising to staff I received explanation that did not at all justify bill and I let them know that this is a clear case of false advertisement. In response, member of staff was rude & arrogant and let me know that in 6 years they have not received complaint regarding promotion. This is something I find very hard to believe given clear false advertisement.

I sent written complaint to hotel to e-mail provided by staff on where to send written complaints. E-mail was sent on 23/08/2025 and I have never received response, despite sending follow up on 27/08/2025.

There was no proper reception or welcome upon arrival.

The lift was extremely slow, adding unnecessary delays.

The kettle provided in the room was made entirely of plastic, with no steel lining inside. Boiling water in plastic is a serious health concern and completely unacceptable.

Room service was unresponsive and unprofessional. I requested plates and was informed they were chargeable and had to be collected by myself – this does not align with any standard of good hospitality.

Despite paying ₹125 for 3 plates and spoons, only 2 plates were delivered. When I called to follow up, there was no response and no one came back to resolve the issue.

I also ordered coffee, but it was never delivered.

mum033,mum033_r5,Priyadharshini V,4,"Overall experience: 4/5. Green spacious property near Oberoi mall, but staff need to come together to deliver a good experience. Westin really needs to fix the house keeping security gap, pre-arrival experience and chef glitches. Most of the folks try harder ( like Ms.Jasmina, head of Housekeeping/Rooms, lounge staff ,the female sous chef etc) to ensure a great experience while others like the front desk, the male sous chef etc doesn't give a damn bringing down the overall experience.

More details below -

Pre-arrival Experience: 1/5. No body called and checked on the arrival time, we wanted an airport pickup which didn't happen, nobody even picked the call at their hotel number given. No response to chat either and finally when I got a call back and while conversing with a staff , she abruptly cut the call. Not a typical Marriott experience to start with, disappointing

Arrival Experience: 5/5. After the disastrous pre-arrival experience, Ms.Jasmina stepped in and fixed the experience for us, with a quick call,  an upgrade and welcomed us with providing a small cake and helped us with the occasion celebration welcome as well.

Rooms: 4.5/5. Spacious, huge rooms which is rare in Mumbai. View is off the highways and walking space around the property. Very close to Oberoi Mall.

Privacy/Safety + Housekeeping : 3/5. We had a huge security incident involving housekeeping. Ms. Jasmina again stepped in, apologized, brought the issue to the attention of the relevant people and helped sorting it out. Other than that, requests were promptly attended to, cleanliness was maintained.

Food : 4/5. We had dinner and breakfast. Dinner lacked continental and seafood. Apparently they had pasta which the team never informed us, which was surprising. The varieties were there at both time and the female sous chef was super friendly ensuring the concerns were addressed. During breakfast, they ensured we get French toast. The male sous chef ( I guess) was super rude and when I asked for koki , he said "" Go, talk to the server and place the order, not to me"" if so, he shouldn't hang around the food counter and ask what do people want. If he doesn't want to do what's asked, then he shouldn't ask. Bizarre behavior. During dinner, they struggled to manage the crowd. A huge container of uncooked chicken was kept in the open kitchen behind the food counters for a long time which wasn't a good health indicator.

Few glitches needs to be addressed which is evident from the other reviews as well.",2025-08-27T05:59:27.476250897Z,a week ago

However, there was no real sense of guest hospitality or welcoming culture. The rooms and in-room amenities were basic and not up to the standards expected from a star-rated hotel.
On a better note, the restaurant area was pleasant. Although the breakfast spread wasn’t very diverse, the food served was quite tasty.
To truly uphold the reputation of a star hotel, the management needs to make significant improvements — a sentiment echoed by many other guests in their reviews. Instead of offering scripted or generic responses, focusing on genuine service improvement would make a meaningful difference.

mum034,mum034_r2,Данила Федотов,1,"Good day everyone! I’ve been in this “beautiful” hotel on July 2025 and what I would like share to you is listed below:
1. Rooms condition- all of us (4 persons) have got identical rooms and all we have got the same problem- dirty room. So bath space corners are black because of mold. Bed sheet was with a black spot. Walls are cracked on corners.
2. Personnel- they are not as kind as they should be.
3. Dining room- I’ve been surprised that the offered water was taken from faucet and there is nothing to drink else. So if you want to drink something like juice or Cola you have to pay extra money for that option. And you might be liked it but I am not, concerning food. So if you think that you will get different kind of food.. your thinks will be vanished by first breakfast. You have two options: hot and real hot. When I eat that food, I feel like my stomach is too infected and I really need to kill all infections inside.. say: “good bye” to your infections and enjoy visiting toilet on the next morning. Too hot for such morning…
4. When I open my window I have a real perfect option to see how all people on railway station (around of 15 meters distance) are looking to my naked body (leaving a part about other interesting things that they could see) after a shower… it’s so incredible!
Now we are coming out of this “beautiful” hotel and we meet garbage station with plenty of garbage trucks around on hotel right side. It's making this hotel unbelievable. You can find a nice garbage river close to left side of hotel apartment as well. So I’ve only one question… Why it’s 4 stars? Who assigned it? My opinion is that it is necessary to remove all stars and put it back to usual hotels.",2025-07-17T08:31:11.382618666Z,a month ago

mum035,mum035_r4,Akshay Pawar,3,"Stayed here for a night and the experience was mixed, leaning towards frustrating. Had to wait over 1.5 hours just to check in, which is the last thing you want after a long day of travel. When I finally got the room, it turned out to be a smoking room — the entire floor reeked of cigarette smoke, despite air filters everywhere. They weren’t helping. The room itself was suffocating.

I requested a room change, and after another 20-minute wait, I was shifted to a non-smoking room with a decent view. That room was better. The space is compact — rooms and bathrooms are small, almost capsule-style — but manageable for a short stay.

However, the towels were old and worn out, which seems to be a recurring issue at a lot of mid-budget hotels these days.

Overall: 6/10. It does the job if you’re catching a flight and need a basic place to crash, but don’t expect efficiency or polish.",2025-08-01T03:56:33.482558884Z,a month ago

mum036,mum036_r1,leon,1,"Guest Feedback – Breakfast Experience

I truly appreciate the quality of service and facilities provided by the hotel—everything is excellent except the breakfast experience.

As an international and globally recognized hotel brand, I expected the breakfast to reflect that standard. Unfortunately, it falls short in several areas:
•	The breakfast lacks international variety and is repeated every day without any change, which becomes boring and does not meet five-star expectations.
•	The food quality is not up to international standards, and there’s no care taken by the restaurant management to improve or adjust the menu.
•	The restaurant staff are friendly and professional, but the management needs to pay closer attention to guest satisfaction, especially for such an important meal.

This feedback is meant as a constructive suggestion, because I believe a hotel of this reputation should offer a more dynamic, high-quality, and internationally appealing breakfast.",2025-07-29T16:36:17.592529314Z,a month ago

mum043,mum043_r3,DR. ANURAG SINGH,5,"The St. Regis Mumbai in Lower Parel is a very popular choice for couples, and for good reason. Here's a review based on common experiences, tailored to a stay with your wife:
A Romantic Getaway at The St. Regis Mumbai
My wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at The St. Regis Mumbai, and it was a truly exceptional experience. From the moment we stepped into the elegant lobby, we were enveloped in a sense of luxury and warmth that made our romantic getaway feel incredibly special.
The location is a definite highlight. Situated in Lower Parel, it's a great base for exploring the city, and the direct connection to the Phoenix Palladium mall is a huge plus. We enjoyed the convenience of having high-end shops, a variety of dining options, and entertainment right at our fingertips, without even having to step outside.
Our room was a sanctuary of comfort and style. The city views were breathtaking, and the plush, high-quality bedding and thoughtful amenities made it easy to relax and unwind. The bathrooms are particularly impressive, with luxurious marble, rainfall showers, and deep-soaking bathtubs that were perfect for a relaxing evening. The attention to detail in the housekeeping was also commendable, with the room kept spotless throughout our stay.
The service is where The St. Regis truly shines. The personalized butler service is a standout feature, and our butler was incredibly attentive and proactive, anticipating our needs and making sure every request was met. The staff across the hotel were friendly, welcoming, and professional, and many guests have noted that they went above and beyond to make their stay memorable. We felt like royalty from start to finish.
For a couple's stay, the amenities are a dream. We took full advantage of the spa, which offers couples' treatment rooms, and it was a wonderfully rejuvenating experience. The outdoor pool on the 10th floor, with its poolside bar and cabanas, provided a perfect spot to relax and enjoy the Mumbai skyline.
Dining was a culinary adventure. The hotel has a fantastic selection of restaurants, and the breakfast buffet at Seven Kitchens was a particular highlight. The spread is immense, offering everything from international favorites to local Indian delicacies, and the quality was superb. We also enjoyed the evening cocktail hours, which added an extra touch of sophistication to our evenings.
In conclusion, our stay at The St. Regis Mumbai was everything we had hoped for and more. The combination of stunning rooms, excellent location, and, most importantly, the unmatched service and hospitality makes it an ideal choice for a romantic retreat. It’s a place that knows how to make you feel pampered and valued, creating memories that will last a lifetime. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",2025-08-28T10:13:36.864515664Z,a week ago
mum043,mum043_r4,Uresh N Patel,5,"I had an absolutely exceptional experience at The St. Regis Mumbai. From the moment I arrived, the attention to detail and level of hospitality were second to none.

Rooms:
The rooms are luxurious, spacious, and impeccably maintained. The blend of comfort and elegance makes it a perfect retreat after a busy day. The city views are stunning, and the in-room amenities are top-tier.

Services:
Every service provided was timely, professional, and seamless. From concierge assistance to room service, everything was handled with care and precision.

Ambience:
The hotel has a grand, refined ambiance that perfectly balances modern sophistication with classic charm. Every corner feels curated and serene — ideal for both relaxation and business.

Food:
Absolutely phenomenal! Whether it's breakfast, fine dining, or room service, every meal was a treat. The variety and quality of the food reflect the hotel’s world-class standards.

Staff:
The highlight of the stay! The staff is genuinely warm, attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile. Their hospitality truly enhances the overall experience.

Disco/Nightclub:
This was the only disappointing part of the experience. The disco was overcrowded to the point of being uncomfortable, and they kept letting more people in — it honestly felt like being in a Mumbai local train during peak hours. Despite spending ₹5,000, there wasn’t even space to dance. It seriously takes away from the premium feel the rest of the hotel offers.

Overall:
Aside from the nightclub experience, The St. Regis Mumbai exceeded all expectations. It’s a perfect destination for anyone looking for luxury, comfort, and top-tier service. I would absolutely return — just might skip the disco next time.",2025-07-13T13:55:36.411199187Z,a month ago

mum046,mum046_r5,Arvind Sarangdhar,1,"I am writing to share my experience during my recent stay at your hotel, which lasted over 22 days. While there were several positive aspects, I feel it is important to bring to your attention some serious concerns that affected the overall quality of my stay.

Firstly, I would like to commend your housekeeping team for maintaining a high standard of room cleanliness and hygiene. The breakfast service was also consistently excellent and a highlight of my stay.

However, I was extremely disappointed with the behavior and attitude of the front desk staff. Throughout my stay, I encountered repeated instances of unprofessionalism and rudeness. Unfortunately, the staff at the front desk and room service lacked basic courtesy and communication skills, which made even routine interactions unpleasant. This level of service does not align with the standards one would expect from a reputable establishment.

I sincerely hope that hotel management takes this feedback seriously. The front desk is often the first and last point of contact for guests, and poor service in this area can significantly harm the reputation of your hotel, regardless of the quality of other services.

I trust you will look into this matter and take appropriate steps to ensure a better experience for future guests.

Thank you for your time and attention.",2025-06-29T08:24:20.508446367Z,2 months ago

The AC was noisy, most of the TV channels were not available, and the bed was not comfortable at all. Cleanliness was up to the mark, but overall, the amenities did not justify the price. Breakfast was average, and lunch and dinner were highly overpriced. While the location is good, there is a need for significant improvement.

The rooms were dirty, stinky, and poorly maintained. My room was a nightmare - it smelled horrible, the air conditioner leaked water, and the fan was not fixed properly, making the stay extremely uncomfortable. But what's even more alarming is the bed bug infestation. I woke up with multiple bites, which is absolutely unacceptable and highlights the hotel's shocking lack of attention to hygiene.

This hotel is in dire need of urgent upgradation. The management's failure to maintain basic standards of cleanliness and comfort is appalling. It's clear that the hotel's infrastructure and amenities are outdated and require immediate renovation.

I strongly advise others to avoid booking this hotel until significant improvements are made. Don't be fooled by the photos - they don't reflect the terrible condition of this property.

From the moment we stepped into The Ambassador, Mumbai, we knew we were in for something special — and wow, did it deliver!

Tucked right in the heart of South Mumbai, this gem combines old-world charm with modern comfort in the most seamless way. The lobby alone makes you feel like you’ve walked into a timeless postcard — elegant, welcoming, and with just the right touch of vintage glamour.

We were a family of explorers, and the hotel became our peaceful haven after each day's adventure. The staff deserves a standing ovation — warm smiles, genuine hospitality, and that rare ability to make you feel like the only guests in the hotel.

Our room was spacious, spotless, and serenely quiet, despite being in one of the city’s most buzzing neighborhoods. Waking up to the golden morning light streaming through the windows, with a view of Mumbai slowly waking up — pure bliss.

And can we talk about the food? The breakfast buffet was a daily festival for our tastebuds. Fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented — from fluffy dosas to international favorites, we were spoiled for choice.

The food at the restaurant was absolutely yum with good variety and Chef Sandeep took really good care of all the guests. The staff at the restaurant, Mr Gaurav and  Mr Ejaj were so courteous and made sure we were being served well and taken care of.
The Banquet hall personnel, assigned for the event , Mr Suresh was a pleasure to work with and helped us coordinate and execute all the technical and administrative requirements with complete ease.
And last but not the least...in fact the most 😄...all this perfectly planned and executed event wouldn't have been possible without the help of Mr Parva, the Banquet manager, who seamlessly coordinated with all other departments, including the restaurant,  to help this get executed so immaculately.
Also would like to mention that one of the guests at the event was using crutches and happened to trip and break one of the crutches and the Hotel staff went out of their way to get it fixed and help the gentleman back to comfortably navigating their way through.

However, there are a few things that could be improved. During early morning checkout, there was a strong unpleasant smell from the toilets in the passage area near the rooms, which was quite off-putting.

The lift is very small and can barely accommodate 2–3 people at a time, which can be inconvenient, especially during check-in or check-out.

Also, while bargaining over the phone for room rates might seem possible, sometimes the agreed rate isn’t honored upon arrival, so it’s better to confirm everything in writing beforehand.

Parking can be an issue, so it’s advisable to call ahead and inform them if you’re arriving with a 4-wheeler. They usually reserve a roadside spot by shifting a two-wheeler, but this only works if arranged in advance.

mum051,mum051_r3,ARNAV KAMBLE,1,"I recently visited The Sahil Hotel expecting a 4-star experience, but unfortunately, it fell quite short. The food was average — taste was just okay and definitely not worth the price. What was most disappointing was the water bottle pricing. A regular ₹20 bottle was being charged at ₹80, which is not just unreasonable but also against government regulations. When I brought this to their notice, they showed no intention of correcting it.
The service was equally disappointing. The waiters were extremely slow and inattentive — they didn’t serve properly and didn’t seem concerned about customer satisfaction at all. For a hotel that claims to be 4-star, this kind of negligence and money-minded behavior is unacceptable.
Honestly, there’s no reason to visit this place again. If they truly want to maintain their name and reputation, they need to work on their hospitality, train their staff, and stop overcharging guests. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and makes changes — because at this rate, they’re losing both credibility and customers.",2025-07-27T18:02:42.957368211Z,a month ago

mum051,mum051_r5,Mamun Ansari,1,"I visited on 15/08/2025, had a very disappointing experience at Hotel Sahil. The food served was of extremely poor quality – tasteless, oily, and far from fresh. The service was equally bad; staff were inattentive, slow to respond, and showed little interest in customer satisfaction.

On top of that, the seating arrangement was completely mismanaged. Guests were left waiting without proper coordination, and the overall atmosphere felt chaotic and uncomfortable.

For a place that claims to be reputable, Hotel Sahil fails miserably in terms of food, service, and basic management. Definitely not worth the time or money.
They purposely ask the guests to give positive review.

mum052,mum052_r1,Anushka Malik,3,"The stay was pretty comfortable.
But I strongly disliked the ethics and moral of the place. I underwent going business but this is plain unethical, never seen any hotel do like this.

To give early check-in they are charging half days rent. You would expect the room will be available as soon as you arrive, but that wasn’t the case there was someone already staying there and paid for full days rent. We had to wait for 2 hrs at the reception.

Firstly they are charging two people for the same room, which I have not seen people doing in general. Then after charging h not providing the adequate service. Could have waited one more hour and saved so much more money.

But again, the location is nice, place was clean. The food was average. But when the ethics are not there in running a business, it’s a big turn off.",2025-06-22T07:31:51.771530417Z,2 months ago

mum053,mum053_r2,Shilpi Sarkar,5,"This is a beautiful hotel with an absolutely olde world charm that transports you to a different time and space in a delightful way.

The staff is extremely polite, courteous, helpful and warm - and also very matter-of-fact. Every individual there is helpful. I was specifically told where to buy reasonably priced items when I needed to make some purchases, and they told me the best way to travel around Bombay - safely and without being overcharged.

I had got a Deluxe room on the second floor. I had a bit of a problem with the bathroom WC in my first room. The staff immediately made the necessary changes and moved me and my luggage to a perfectly fine room with a small but charming balcony and a lovely view.

The rooms are big, airy, and spacious with gorgeous large and long windows - which let in light, and from where one can see the beautiful tree-lined avenue, and the rooms and rhe halls have a different array of fixtures and furniture - which add to the lovely experience. I had one meal there - a late-night dinner of sandwiches - which was mighty good and filling.

Yes, there were some problems I had with the WCs but the hotel staff mentioned that they use recycled water (for the WC) - and that is a commendable practice. However, they mentioned that the WCs were being replaced in the rooms - as a part of a renovation process.

Yes, does the world look old and lived-in? Yes. But it looks grand. Can some parts of the railings and beautiful winding staircase be fixed? - Sure. But none of these detract from the distinctiveness of the place.

Also, the staff let me know that all rooms and common areas are currently in the process of being renovated and refurbished.

The kind, courteous and matter-of-fact staff even mentioned specifically that I should include any constructive criticism in my public feedback. If that doesn't say something fantastic and utterly decent and honest about The Grand Hotel Team - I don't see what else can.

I am sorry that I didn't get their names this time - otherwise I would have thanked each member of the team, individually, with their names. All of them made my stay a special and precious one.

If I visit Bombay again - there is no question - I would stay here!

The location is absolutely superb - of course, the hotel itself is gorgeous in an olde world way that even a modern-day hotel chain may not be able to recreate, and the Team there is brilliant.

I hope too that they retain some of the lovely, old furniture and fixtures and the glorious large windows and small but beautiful balconies while they renovate the rooms and other areas.

Staying at The Grand Hotel is an experience that I cherish for many reasons, and I thank the entire team for making my visit such a beautiful and perfect one.",2025-06-29T03:16:34.187822449Z,2 months ago

Then I told him that I’ve used it before so he said - it’s under maintainance. He said he can’t help me. When I sensed he is lying and reminded him that women have the right to washroom, he cut me out sharply  that only after 10 in the night.

Starting from the top: once you enter the hotel, there’s valet service, which, as usual, is efficient.

Then, you head to the reception and provide your name along with the name and room number of the person you’re visiting. I think that’s a great measure in terms of security, as they only hand over an extra room key after confirming with their guest.

Now, coming to the room. The rooms here are quite spacious, with comfortable beds, clean washrooms, an iron, television, and all the basic amenities you’d expect.

I had dinner at the restaurant here. To my surprise, the food didn’t live up to the hotel’s standards. The service was slow, and to make things worse, the food was poorly cooked—perhaps due to some issue in the kitchen. However, I must applaud the waitstaff; they genuinely tried to make up for it with their attentive service. So, I wouldn’t recommend this place if you’re planning to dine in. Hopefully, the management takes note and works on improving this.

Last but not least—music. I must say, the hotel has hired some truly talented singers. Their performances can make your evening or even your entire day feel soothing and memorable. So even if not for the food, do stop by to enjoy the live music. It’s definitely worth it.",2025-04-25T09:08:18.889975Z,4 months ago

My wife booked the Glass Prism birthday celebration at Hotel Aureole, and it was a huge disappointment. The food was rushed out with no care or presentation, staff were rude and dismissive, and the whole thing was absurdly overpriced for what we got.

The AC wasn’t working, leaving the small spacehot and stuffy. The speaker was muffled and broken, so even the music sounded terrible. For a venue that claims to host celebrations, these are the most basic things — and they completely failed.

What makes it worse is that the place looks nothing like the pictures online. The photos are misleading and paint a far better image than reality. In truth, the setup is shabby, poorly maintained, and nowhere close to the premium vibe they advertise.

Overall, this was a total waste of money. The celebration mood was ruined, and instead of happy memories, we were left frustrated. I strongly recommend avoiding Hotel Aureole’s Glass Prism — don’t waste your time, don’t waste your money.",2025-08-23T20:31:11.352913985Z,a week ago

They also have good breakfast 🥞 options available. Not too many variety like 5 star ⭐ hotel but definitely enough to enjoy.

The restaurant and many other services are either closed or under maintenance 🔧 and you won't be able to enjoy it. The room is well maintained but still needs a lot of replacement and maintenance.

mum061,mum061_r3,Vivek,4,"Had stayed at this place last year when I visited Mumbai for the Tata Lit Fest. It's at a walkable distance from Gateway. Decent breakfast and dinner options available. Room had huge windows and good height which gave it a bright and spacious aura esp for me who easily feels claustrophobic. Food tasted good (however the room service guy charged more than what the menu card mentioned)

During checkout I left my watch and rings in the hotel room. The guy at the reception was extremely helpful to keep these safe till I returned to collect them. The watch was a precious gift from a loved one hence was really grateful to the reception guy to keep it safe. Guidance with respect to modes of travels and places was also appreciable.

From the moment the elevator doors opened, I felt as if I had stepped into another dimension. The warm welcome from a radiant young lady—an angel in human form—set the tone for what would be an unforgettable evening. Her bright smile and graceful presence guided me to my table.

At the table, I was served by a gentleman whose politeness and efficiency perfectly matched the excellence of the meal. The Indian cuisine was simply the finest I’ve ever tasted. Combined with the elegant atmosphere and the flawless staff, the experience was nothing short of extraordinary.

Incredible India—there’s a reason for this slogan. My sincere compliments to everyone at Prima Nadal for creating such a memorable moment.

They have an excellent breakfast buffet - continental, South Indian, a range of breads, cheeses, juices and even smoked salmon! This place is certainly underrated and more people need to know that this is a great option to consider in the Andheri area.
Gaurav’s quick and prompt service and Lakpa’s friendly assistance made it even more memorable.

mum062,mum062_r4,Ripin Kotecha,3,"Everything apart from the check in host lying about keys was good.
We had pre booked transport to the hotel and the drivers were waiting exactly where we were told they would be.  They took us to our hotel efficiently.

Everything including check in appeared to be okay.  I was given one key for each of our 2 rooms to share between 5 guests.  When I asked for an extra key, I was told this was not possible as there was already a key in the light system and if she issued another key, the keys already issued would stop working.  I also requested extra duvets for one of the rooms.

The hotel lifts only allow access to the floor your room is on using the key and the communal floors.  We found this out when we entered the lifts to go to our rooms on floors 2 and 5.  This had not been explained to us.

As we arrived quite late, we went straight to dinner.  This is when the key issue became a problem.  We had taken the key out of the electrical systems to ensure that we could go back to our rooms individually.  The key from the electrical system has a hole drilled into it, so does not work for the doors or the lifts.  I ended up back downstairs, spoke to another receptionist, who immediately gave me extra keys for the rooms.  Thus showing that the original receptionist had outright lied to us.

When I got back to the room, the duvets had not been delivered.  This was an hour after we first checked in.  Again a visit to the different receptionist ensured that they were delivered promptly.

The rest of the stay, although brief, was comfortable and good.

The hotel would receive maximum stars if the original receptionist had not lied and failed to get the duvets sent to the room.",2025-08-25T05:33:38.181022516Z,a week ago

Now this hotel, offers a heritage, by having their location almost at the heart of the city, just opposite of the Bombay Hospital, offers a great experience in providing old school hotel charm to the residents. But, during my stay, whereas they have offered me a good spacious room at 4th floor, they allocated two shady rooms to one of my male colleague and one female colleague, where the floor was renovated, dimly lit and having dust, stolen/discarded items from Bombay hospital like IV stands!! If you go through my photos, you will find these scary photos! Rest, I have rated the services 'good' since they have a very old school charm restaurant, which took us back to 90's and the stewards are excellent.

There is renovation activity going in the rooms and lift, which caused significant inconvenience. We asked to change our room to slightly bigger room on day 2 and they upgraded us stating that it is of the same price. That room was even more spacious except that the area above our room was under construction. After a while there was continuous drilling noise which was unbearable. We requested to stop the activity but the manager at reception simply said that ""we can not stop the construction"". We asked then change the room or refund the money as we were unable to stay. They agreed to change the room at different floor and told us that staff will clean the room in half an hour and then they will inform us to shift. No one came for the next 3-4 hours and the construction activity also stopped. Then around 4pm, we went to have food from outside and one member stayed back as he was having fever. The moment we stepped outside again the drilling noise started. The person who stayed back called at reception to stop it. But the manager did not listen and responded that you can change the room immediately if you want but noise will continue. We did not change the room but stayed outside of the hotel till the time construction was ON upto 8pm. I've stayed at lot of hotels in Mumbai and haven't seen this kind of treatment with guests. I also asked the manager to connect me with the management to that I can apprise them but he said they are not available. I recommend avoid staying at this hotel as they do not care about the guests.

We decided to stay at this hotel during our transit through Mumbai, and it proved to be an excellent choice. Although it’s situated on a modest property, the rooms are exceptionally clean, and the staff is courteous, friendly, and always willing to help.

The rooms are well-equipped, and I particularly appreciated the complimentary bottled water—something that usually comes with a charge in India. The biggest perk is its close proximity to the airport terminals, which is a major advantage considering the often congested traffic in the city.

The main street leading to the hotel can get quite busy, and may turn into a mess during the monsoon season. Their restaurant is a short five-minute walk across the street, but they do offer a delicious free buffet breakfast along with other tasty options.

Staff is very friendly, plenty of mineral water bottles free of cost.

I saw a lot of negative reviews for this hotel and was a bit hesitant to book but I'm leaving with no regrets. For the prices paid, my stay was just amazing. The location is a big advantage as the Juhu beach is just at the walking distance and the food joints are also close by. The famous Prithvi theatre and cafe is just 15 mins away on foot.

We booked 2 economy rooms, 1 room had a little dull lighting while the other was perfect. The bathrooms are a bit smelly and needs renovation. Mosquitoes is an issue but its nothing that can't be fixed, just ask the hotel staff for an extra coil in your room while you're out or carry your own mosquito fast cards/repellent. Also there's a club neighboring the hotel which plays very loud music until 2 am so that might a problem for some guests.

The breakfast buffet which was included in our stay was yum. They have a lot of variety of food and a live egg station. The ambience of the hotel from outside is very cozy. Feels like you're actually living in a garden which justifies the hotel name.",2025-02-22T16:14:34.712552Z,6 months ago

When I brought up an issue, they weren't supportive at all and didn't seem to care about resolving the problem. Very poor customer service. Wouldn't recommend staying here because of the lack of support from the reception team.

Reply to the Hotel President reply:
Please consider this my final message on the matter. This is not a request for further dialogue but a review—an honest reflection of what occurred, and nothing will change the outcome.

Despite clearly raising the issue, at that moment no actions were taken by the entire reception staff to address or resolve it. The complete lack of initiative and professionalism from the front desk was unacceptable and fell far below the standard one reasonably expects from a 5-star hotel.

It is especially disappointing because the rest of your team performed at a high level, showing courtesy and professionalism; unfortunately, the failure at reception overshadowed that positive impression.

Watching the waves crash gently, enjoying the cool breeze, and walking barefoot on the sand while the sun set in the background created beautiful memories that we’ll cherish forever. The beach access from the hotel made it so convenient to step out and unwind any time we wanted.

The hospitality was warm, the surroundings peaceful, and the atmosphere perfect for relaxation and bonding. Whether it was sipping tea by the poolside or just soaking in the calmness of the sea, every moment felt like a much-needed escape from the everyday routine.

The second day the fish dish we ordered was so bitter taste and they have to take back the dish.
At the end while check out, we have declared the out we used from the minibar, but unfortunately the reception staff and housekeeping manager was so adamant and insisting is to charge for a sprite which we haven't used.  Do they think the customer paying such high rent in the property and to lie for a sprite?  The behavior of the staff was very bad and it was not at all acceptable.

Sleep was comfortable and the room pretty good, you get what you pay for.

The décor is very cool and gives off a great vibe, and the customer service was absolutely amazing. The staff were warm, friendly, and genuinely caring.

The location is a big plus, very central and convenient. It’s easy to commute anywhere from there, and there are great shopping options nearby, including two shopping centres directly opposite the hotel and a large supermarket close by. That was definitely a highlight.

However, there were a few downsides. The food was just okay. As someone who can get an upset stomach easily, especially while traveling, it was frustrating that there weren’t any mild or comfort food options. Everything was quite oily spicy and full of masala. It would have been great to have simple choices like plain toast, potatoes, or other bland foods. The croissant I had was very oily and still managed to be dry.  Even the toast I requested took 15 minutes to arrive, which wasn’t ideal when I wasn’t feeling well.

Also, one small annoyance: there was a video advert playing on loop in the lift with a woman  and it became pretty irritating over time, it wasn’t even a good advert.

That said, despite the food and that one annoying ad, I would return. The overall experience was good, and the location, vibe, and excellent service made up for the few drawbacks. Oooh and the BED was soooo good, it honestly felt like sleeping on a cloud.",2025-05-31T13:12:57.232299Z,3 months ago

mum089,mum089_r2,Aditya Kumar,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience – Would Not Recommend

My stay at VITS was one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had, especially from a customer service standpoint.

My stay was booked for 14 days and found the hotel’s rules to be extremely rigid and customer-unfriendly. For instance, outside food was completely prohibited. While some hotels have similar policies, they usually show some empathy toward guests staying for long durations — occasionally allowing exceptions. Unfortunately, VITS showed zero flexibility or understanding. Even when I tried to bring in food just for a change of taste, they insisted I discard it at the main gate.

To make matters worse, the staff — including the guards at the entrance and receptionists — were outright rude and dismissive throughout my stay. There was no sense of hospitality or effort to make the guest feel welcome or comfortable.

I had also booked dinner at the hotel but after a long workday, I requested to have my meal in my room. Even that was flatly denied. Apparently, you're expected to eat the hotel’s food, in the dining area, every single day for two weeks — no exceptions.

Eventually i checked out of this hotel before my scheduled end date. I will never return to this hotel and do not recommend it to anyone, especially for extended stays.",2025-08-05T11:41:19.767183006Z,a month ago

IRA Hotel Staff,
After posting my review, I received a call from your team saying that you had informed us about the smoking policy. However, I want to make it clear that no one from your staff gave us any such information at the time of check-in.
If someone is seen smoking, it is standard and fair practice to first issue a warning before directly imposing a fine. Instead, your team suddenly demanded ₹5000 — this feels like a deliberate attempt to extract money from guests by placing allegations without proper communication.
It seems your focus is more on collecting fines than on genuinely guiding customers.
Also, I request you to please do not call me again on my number, especially not on a Sunday.
I have only written in my review what I genuinely experienced during my stay — nothing extra or false.",2025-07-27T13:35:38.829346641Z,a month ago
mum089,mum089_r4,Anurag Tripathi,1,"We recently stayed at IRA Hotel, Mumbai, and had a very unpleasant experience that I feel others should be aware of.

Firstly, we were not informed at check-in about the hotel's no-smoking policy. There were no clear signs or verbal communication from the staff. My colleague took out a cigarette in the room, and within minutes hotel staff showed up and demanded ₹5000 as a penalty. It felt like a trap – an unfair and aggressive way to extract money from guests.

If the hotel is scanning bags and checking guests physically at check-in, why not inform or remove prohibited items at that time? This would prevent such situations. But instead, it seems like a deliberate setup to charge hefty fines without giving guests a fair warning.

This was a very bad experience. I feel the hotel is taking advantage of guests under the pretext of policies that are not clearly communicated.

Please be very careful if you plan to stay here. Definitely not a guest-friendly approach, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

I initially thought what happened with me was an isolated incident, but after checking the reviews now, it’s clear this hotel is consistently cheating and mistreating guests. Back-to-back negative feedbacks clearly show that most guests are being harassed and looted here.

The staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. Their behavior is arrogant, and instead of making guests feel welcome, they intimidate and threaten over petty issues just to extract money. In my case, they charged ₹5000 forcibly without giving any prior information or warning — and now I see this is their regular trick with guests!

This place is a scam in the name of a hotel. Management is shamelessly ignoring repeated complaints. It’s shocking how they’re still allowed to operate!

Avoid this place at all costs if you don’t want to ruin your trip. Don’t fall for their fake pictures or fake promises — reality is much worse!",2025-07-27T13:48:51.260597281Z,a month ago

The staff appered poorly trained and lacked attentiveness,
Additionally, the air conditioning in my sisters room was not functioning. Despite multiple complains, it wasn't fixed for two full days. It was finally addressed on the third day, but only after repeated follows-ups.

Additionally, the staff expected tips for basic services—the bellboy wouldn't leave without ₹200, and housekeeping demanded ₹500 daily.

Property is shared by Marriott & Westin, yet management and coordination were very poor.

Room service was extremely slow – had to call multiple times for basic requests.

Spa booking was mishandled – unprofessional and inflexible staff.

Buffet food quality was below average – chicken and fish smelled, waffles tasted raw, and counters were closed abruptly at 11.

Staff behavior was rude at several points, including restaurant and management.

Common area washrooms were unhygienic and unattended.

In-room facilities outdated – no smart TV, only unsubscribed Tata Sky channels.

Shockingly, found a spider inside the wardrobe.

I never expected. At the end while checkout no one even helped with the luggage  and no one came for the same. Gave the call and it was more than 25mi  we waited and yet didnt hear anything.

mum092,mum092_r2,O. D.,2,"I’ve been staying at the Taj Wellington Mews for an extended period and initially looked forward to the experience, especially given the hotel’s reputation. While the staff have consistently been kind, polite, and eager to help, my overall experience with the room conditions and the way issues were handled by management has been frustrating and disappointing.

The air-conditioning in the living room was malfunctioning from early on. Despite numerous visits from the engineering team, the issue remained unresolved for over a month. It eventually required ceiling work, which forced me to vacate my room on extremely short notice—with less than 12 hours to pack and move into a temporary room before work the next morning.

The room also suffered from water leakage during heavy rain due to poorly sealed windows.

Other ongoing problems included an unstable dishwasher, frequent internet disconnections, and cockroaches spotted in the room on two separate occasions.

Despite repeated and reasonable requests for a permanent room change, no alternative was offered for several weeks. When I was eventually informed via message that I would be moved to an “equivalent or better accommodation,” I was later told this had been a typing error and that I would need to return to my original room. This also happened on short notice—right after I had returned from work—without clear communication.

That same evening, I learned that my temporary room had already been promised to another guest, which explained the urgency with which I was being asked to vacate. This created unnecessary pressure on both myself and the other guest and led to a very uncomfortable situation. After a long and ultimately unproductive discussion with the management team, I moved back into my original room the following day—only to discover that not all previously reported issues had been resolved.

While the service staff have remained consistently courteous, the overall handling of these problems—especially for a long-term guest—did not meet the standards one expects from a hotel under the Taj brand. The lack of communication and accountability from management left a lasting impression of poor guest care.

To be clear: the service staff are lovely and well-intentioned. But the way room issues and guest concerns are managed is inefficient and poorly coordinated. For short-term stays, this may not be as noticeable—but for long-term guests, it makes a significant difference.

Until there is a stronger level of accountability from the management team, I unfortunately cannot recommend this hotel to colleagues or friends seeking long-term accommodations in Mumbai.",2025-07-04T21:23:40.701088716Z,2 months ago

My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Taj Wellington Mews Apartments in Mumbai for three and a half months, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. As we were both recovering from surgery, walking was difficult, but the incredible staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Their care, attentiveness, and willingness to assist made all the difference during our recovery.

From housekeeping to the restaurant, catering, gym, spa, and swimming pool, every team member provided exceptional service. A special mention to Gauri, Pooja, Similda, and Satish, from the housekeeping department, whose kindness and attention to detail made our daily routines effortless. The hospitality of Hendrik, Gaurav, Vignesh, and Ashish, from catering, also stood out—they were incredibly welcoming and always ensured we had everything we needed.

We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the front desk and concierge staff—Mayur, Shailesh, Pratiksha, Raya, Regina, Dipti, and Tina—who were always warm, helpful, and accommodating. They made every request seamless and ensured our stay was hassle-free. The housekeeping team deserves special recognition for maintaining our space so beautifully and always going the extra mile to make us comfortable.

The gym staff, Sandeep, Lalit, and Nitin were fantastic in helping us navigate workouts suited to our recovery, always offering guidance and encouragement. Similarly, the swimming pool team, Sudhir, Atiq, Premnath and Rohidas ensured we could fully enjoy the pool facilities, assisting us whenever needed and making every visit effortless.

The security staff also deserve high praise for their courtesy and professionalism. They not only ensured a safe and secure environment but also facilitated our movement within the resort, making it easier for us to get around despite our mobility challenges. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist truly enhanced our experience.

A special thank you to Ranjit and the whole gardening team whose dedication to maintaining the lush, serene surroundings made our time at the Taj even more enjoyable. Their beautifully kept gardens provided us with a peaceful retreat every day.

The facilities at the Taj Apartments are world-class. Despite our mobility limitations, the staff made sure we could fully enjoy the amenities, whether it was arranging assistance for the gym, spa, and pool or making dining effortless with impeccable restaurant and catering services. The level of care and consideration we received was truly remarkable.

Overall, our experience was nothing short of extraordinary. This was made possible by the efforts and management of the management team, led by Mrs Indrani Gupta, assisted by Mr Sushant Chavan and all the other managers in the various departments mentioned above.  The warmth, dedication, and professionalism of the entire team turned what could have been a challenging period into a seamless and luxurious stay. We felt truly looked after, and for that, we are immensely grateful. Thank you, Taj, for your outstanding hospitality and care.

mum093,mum093_r1,MR ADITYA,5,"I recently stayed at Le Sutra Hotel in Khar, Mumbai, and honestly, it was one of the most unique and memorable hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

From the moment I walked in, I could tell this place wasn’t your typical hotel. The artwork and themes in every corner are absolutely stunning. Each floor and room is inspired by Indian philosophy—mine was the “Krishna” room, and it was beautifully done with paintings, sculptures, and a calming blue color palette. It really felt like staying in a little art gallery.

Rooms:
My room was super clean, cozy, and well-maintained. The bed was extremely comfortable, the linen fresh, and the lighting was soft and peaceful. They also had all the essentials—tea/coffee maker, mini fridge, and a well-stocked bathroom with quality toiletries.

Service:
The staff were incredibly polite and attentive. From the front desk to housekeeping, everyone made me feel welcome. I even got a small tour of the art theme behind my room when I asked—such a nice touch! They really take hospitality seriously here.

Location:
It’s in a perfect spot—just a few minutes away from Bandra and Carter Road. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shopping spots nearby, but the hotel still feels peaceful and quiet.

Food:
I had breakfast at the in-house restaurant Out of the Blue—delicious! The spread was fresh, and they had good options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I also tried a pasta dish one evening, and it was top-notch.",2025-07-17T13:02:44.774477600Z,a month ago
mum093,mum093_r2,Natasha Singh,1,"Spa is disappointing!

First, they have a strange system where the therapist takes oil from a PUMP bottle. So each time you drift into relaxation, she has to stop, pump 3-4 times & come back with oil! No continuity of massage, so how does one relax??!

Second, I was informed that the lights would go off in the bathroom (steam + shower) after 10 minutes, and I should wave my hand for the sensor to detect, which worked the first time. The second time, the lights would just not come on!

To be in a non-familiar bathroom with no lights, tiles slippery due to steam, absolutely dark, was claustrophobic & dangerous!

When I raised this at the reception, I got no real response & they were busy with another group. In short, they don't care!

They also claim they treat all guests as if adults. Yes that’s not true (as discussed above).

I cannot believe they call the rooms for advertising for their own services. I was in a nap and they called to see if I would book their spa for the weekend.

I usually don’t write negative reviews, but this stay was truly unacceptable. The overall service quality was poor and far below expectations for any decent hotel.

➡️ Rooms:
The rooms were in a pathetic condition. They were smelly, poorly maintained, and lacked basic cleanliness. The shower head was broken, there was water leakage in the bathroom, and worst of all — there was no hot water available during my stay.

➡️ Meeting Halls:
We had a business meeting scheduled, and the experience was equally frustrating. At times, the AC was completely off making the hall suffocating, and when it did work, it was set to freezing temperatures with no regulation — making it uncomfortable for everyone.

➡️ Overall Service:
The staff seemed indifferent to complaints and did not make any efforts to address the issues we raised. There was no sense of urgency or accountability.

I do not recommend this hotel to anyone — whether you’re visiting for business or leisure. There are far better options available nearby. Definitely not worth the money.",2025-06-18T09:33:09.954698570Z,2 months ago

The room was filthy: stained sheets, mold in the bathroom, and a stench that made it impossible to sleep comfortably. I requested housekeeping and was told they “don’t do room cleaning every day,” but no one came the entire stay. When I brought up these concerns, the manager not only dismissed me but was condescending and unapologetic. It’s clear that customer satisfaction is the last thing on their priority list.

mum098,mum098_r4,Kasim Shaikh,1,"I booked a standard room for 2 adults at a discounted rate of ₹1,500 via Agoda. Unfortunately, the room had several issues:

The door lock was broken, and the alternative lock was very tight

No lock on the bathroom door

Shower tap and toilet seat cover were both damaged

No basic amenities like a kettle, glass, or even a dustbin in the bathroom

No bathroom mat was provided — we had to use the towel instead

Only one towel for two guests

The room had cockroaches and some mosquitoes

No windows — the room felt completely closed and lacked ventilation

Ongoing construction next to the room caused a lot of noise

Positives:

Hand spray in the bathroom had good water pressure

The area around the hotel was quiet

There was enough space beside the bed for two people to comfortably perform prayer

While there were a few good aspects, the condition of the room was poor. I can’t speak for other rooms, but based on this experience, I wouldn’t stay here again.",2025-07-30T01:24:31.880828379Z,a month ago

2. Lights fittings were loose in bathroom.
3. Open wires in bathroom was very risky.
4. Shower nob was loose.
5. Seepage marks on walls.
6. We waited for 30 mins for breakfast after informing them. Every thing was cold and tasteless. It seems they order it from outside local shop and give it to u.
7. There were cockroachs on bed.
8. Bed was not aligned and was shaking.
9. Set top box was missing so we didn't had anything to watch.
10. Best part is they charge or water bottle when you check in. Or else you have to drink thier open water in jug.

It is a great hotel if you want to get to terminal I or Terminal II, as the entry to the T1 Metro station allows you to walk in comfort and style to the T1 departures. Airport Drop facility is available with the hotel. As regards the restaurant, food is at a quite reasonable rate, and the food's taste is also Amazing 😊. Approaching Road to the hotel is somewhat narrow, but we can ignore, it is peaceful to stay. Thank you, T24 and staff.

The area is extremely unhygienic, and the hotel itself is just as bad. The rooms are tiny and not suitable for anyone even slightly claustrophobic. Bedsheets and pillows were clearly not cleaned, the bathroom was in a horrible state, and there were no fresh towels. All we were given were two tiny Medimix soaps—no handwash, no shower gel, nothing else.

There’s barely any space to keep luggage, and to make it worse, when we arrived early, the receptionist asked for ₹1500 extra to check in early. ₹500 might still be understandable, but ₹1500 was just unreasonable. The service was awful and unhelpful throughout.

Also, if you have any extra luggage, just forget this hotel. You’ll have to drag everything through a narrow, dirty street because the hotel isn’t even on the main road. It’s located in one of the worst areas I’ve seen in Mumbai. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone—not even for a night.",2025-07-13T06:12:54.050054564Z,a month ago

Unacceptable Service
The lack of courtesy and basic hospitality was staggering. It was clear that the staff didn't care about providing a pleasant experience for their guests. I was shocked by their attitude and behavior, which made my stay incredibly uncomfortable.

I deeply regret staying at this so-called 3-star hotel near Saki Naka and Marol metro stations. It was a harrowing experience, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, especially those unfamiliar with Mumbai.

The place is filthy, with a terrible stench permeating the entire property. It’s clear they don’t prioritize cleanliness or guest comfort. The location is equally awful—traveling just 2 km took me 40 minutes, and getting to the airport, which should have been quick, took over an hour.

The worst part, however, was at checkout. They demanded I pay extra for dubious charges. When I refused, they brought in goons to intimidate me. Since they are locals, even the police were reluctant to get involved, leaving me feeling helpless and unsafe.

To make matters worse, this hotel clearly caters to couples looking for privacy and isn’t suitable for travelers or families. If you’re not from Mumbai, avoid this place at all costs—it’s unsafe, unprofessional, and a complete scam.

Save yourself the nightmare and book a proper, reputable hotel elsewhere. This was, without a doubt, my worst experience ever.",2024-12-13T21:30:41.513783Z,8 months ago
mum108,mum108_r1,Nevil Goyani,1,"**Review of Hotel Orient – Poor Customer Service and Unreasonable Charges**

My wife and I had a booking at Hotel Orient from 5th May to 6th May 2025. Despite informing them in advance that I would arrive between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM, I reached slightly later, between 7:30 AM and 8:00 AM. Upon arrival, the staff coldly informed me that check-in was only at 12:00 PM and refused to accommodate me in any way.

I politely requested if they could allocate any available room for just four hours, or if I could pay extra to extend my booking to cover the early check-in. Shockingly, they demanded an additional ₹2200 for just four hours—almost the same price as my original booking (₹2222 for a full day)! This was completely unreasonable and exploitative.

To make matters worse, the staff behaved in a rude, dismissive, and humiliating manner. Their lack of basic hospitality and unwillingness to assist a guest in need forced me to leave and book a stay at Hotel National next door, where I was treated with respect.

Never staying at Hotel Orient again—I strongly advise others to avoid this place if they expect even basic courtesy and fair treatment.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff were extremely polite, friendly, and caring — it truly felt like home. Initially, we were given a room, but as a thoughtful gesture, the hotel upgraded us to a very spacious room which made our stay even more comfortable.

The most special moment was when the hotel invited our mom to host the Independence Day flag hoisting ceremony on August 15, honoring her as a special guest. This was a very touching and memorable experience for our entire family.

A big thank you to the management and staff for making our stay so special. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumbai, especially families with kids.",2025-08-20T10:51:57.290748764Z,2 weeks ago

mum109,mum109_r4,Vinod Ladda,5,"Hotel Parle International is a very decent hotel.
I stayed here for 13 days this year, as well as last year, and the experience was truly cozy. The corridors are  maintained at cooler temperature, quiet , aesthetically pleasing and spotless and well-lit with bright lighting. The housekeeping staff are humble and prompt. I especially appreciate Manjunath, who is always polite and used to greet with warm smile . Pramila Madam (In-charge) personally visited every day to enquire if I needed anything. My thanks to both of them.

The complimentary breakfast was also good. However, I would suggest placing eggitarian items separately, away from the rest of the food. The catering staff — Suroj, Paul, and Garri — are all humble and happy to serve.

The front office staff — Sachin, Rohit, Vijayan, Ruchita, and Smita Madam — are professional and efficient in their services. How could I forget the bell boys Pawan, Maruti, and Anil Jadhav — truly helpful and polite.

The atmosphere is peaceful. However, the internet and mobile network are poor, even though Wi-Fi extenders and signal boosters are installed. I could barely conduct professional Zoom meetings without interruptions. In the last two days of my stay, I experienced some inconvenience due to the strong smell of turpentine/oil paint from rooms being painted on the upper floor. The bathroom showers also had low water pressure at times.

Overall, it was the delightful experience.

Exceptional Experience at Hotel Carlton!
I had an amazing stay at Hotel Carlton. The rooms were clean, spacious, and beautifully maintained. The interior decor was elegant, and the ambiance was peaceful and relaxing.

The staff was extremely professional, courteous, and always ready to help with a smile. Room service was quick and efficient, and the housekeeping did a fantastic job every day.

The hotel's location is also perfect — centrally located with easy access to nearby attractions. The food, especially the breakfast buffet, was delicious and had a wide variety of options.

Cons :
1. A major concern to attend was using typical naphthalene smelling phenol in common areas which was not recommended, this could be avoided.
2. Cheap handwash liquid (rose color) to avoid as it causes a strong smell not liked by all.
3.  Laundry can be moved to a different section (next to friend zone) to avoid sound while sleeping.
3. Reception could have more seating arrangements.

We had a very unpleasant experience with this hotel. Despite thoroughly checking their website and successfully making a booking by paying ₹2000, we were denied entry upon arrival. The staff claimed there was a technical error and our booking ID wasn’t showing in their system.

To make matters worse, they informed us that the hotel does not allow unmarried couples — something that was not clearly mentioned during the booking process. Only after revisiting the website later did we find this restriction buried deep in the terms and conditions, placed in a way that’s easy to miss. It’s unreasonable to expect guests to read through multiple pages just to find such a critical detail.

Unfortunately, we received no refund, as the staff insisted the policy was listed and we should have read it thoroughly. This experience was extremely frustrating and disappointing.

mum117,mum117_r3,A L A Y I N,2,"Hotel Shabana, Colaba – Honest Review

Finding Hotel Shabana in the narrow lanes of Colaba can be quite a task. It’s tucked away in a confusing part of the street without proper signboards, making it difficult for first-time visitors to locate. Even after finding the entrance, actually getting into the hotel isn’t smooth—there’s very limited access space and no proper reception area welcoming guests.

Space is a major issue overall. The property feels cramped, and there’s barely any room to move around, especially near the rooms. If you’re someone who values breathing space and comfort, this might be a concern.

Inside the rooms, the condition is average at best. The bedsheets and blankets didn’t seem freshly laundered, which gave off a slightly unpleasant impression. Cleanliness clearly needs more attention, particularly for essentials like bedding.

However, the saving grace of this hotel is its staff. The team is genuinely friendly and very helpful. They make an effort to assist with anything you need and are always polite and welcoming—which goes a long way in making your stay a little better.

Overall, if you’re looking for a budget option in a prime location, and don’t mind tight spaces or average cleanliness, Hotel Shabana could work. Just come in with the right expectations",2025-06-05T04:32:14.975774Z,3 months ago

The reception guy was decent enough to return the full amount we paid only because we said we are lawyers from Kerala(not me l, my wife is).

I made my booking over the phone and clearly requested a check-in on the 21st early morning and check-out the same day in the evening. They initially agreed to this and I paid the advance.

However, the next day, they called me and said the check-out time is 11:00 AM on the 21st. If I want to stay until the evening, I would have to pay for an extra full day.

I explained everything from the beginning, but they are not willing to accept it. Very, very disappointing and unprofessional.",2025-05-20T06:45:29.840306Z,3 months ago

mum120,mum120_r4,Anupam Mishra,3,"Backpackers Villa Mumbai is a budget-friendly, dormitory-style accommodation ideal for travelers looking for an affordable stay. It’s conveniently located near JB Nagar Metro Station and just about 15 minutes from Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Terminal 2, making it a good option for those transiting through Mumbai.

The place is neat and clean, with a spacious common area where travelers can relax or meet fellow backpackers. However, there are a few downsides that travelers should be aware of.

One major issue is the air conditioning policy — the AC is turned off after 9 a.m. and only switched back on at night, no matter how many times you request it. This can make the rooms uncomfortably hot during the day, so if you plan to stay indoors or rest during the daytime, this may not be the best choice.

Additionally, the kitchen could use significant improvement. It was quite dirty during my stay, and the utensils provided were of poor quality, making it less appealing for guests who want to cook their own meals.

Overall, while Backpackers Villa offers a convenient location and affordable rates, there’s room for improvement in service and amenities. It’s a decent option for short overnight stays or transits, but not recommended if you need to spend a lot of time indoors during the day.",2025-05-07T17:41:05.543043Z,4 months ago

The rooms are completely opposite of what is shown in the pictures.

The condition of the rooms is utterly *disgusting*. Cockroaches everywhere, broken bathroom doors, leaky ceilings, and a foul, unbearable stench due to water seepage. The place feels completely neglected and unhygienic.

At this point in my travels I thought I had seen the worst accommodation - then this came along. The rooms are filthy and there are insects everywhere. Not just in the rooms, but in the corridors and bathrooms. The staff don't care. The bed linen was dirty with some kind of red colour (blood?) and the whole room didn't invite you to stay. We felt disgusted and moved to another room in a nearby hotel.

That would be bad enough, but we were actually ripped off and paid double. We arrived late in the evening and there was a man at reception waiting for us. He checked us in, but didn't mind telling us we were in the wrong place. We ended up paying for two hostels even though we didn't stay a night.

Tldr; don't stay there! Spend some more money and get a decent room. I don't get why there are so many goods reviews. Maybe they are fake. We pay doubled and booked another room. Never again.",2025-01-14T18:46:27.068423Z,7 months ago

We booked a room on 16/08/2025 and clearly informed the staff that we would be arriving around 2–3 AM, expecting the room to be ready. Upon arrival, we were shocked to find water on the floor and the entire mattress soaking wet.

When we informed Ahmed about this, instead of helping, he behaved rudely and arrogantly. He refused to give us a refund and suggested another room at a different location, insisting we take a taxi there and leave our cars behind. Why should guests be inconvenienced like this, and who would be responsible for our vehicles?

When we asked for a proper solution, Ahmed simply said he would “turn the mattress” and told us to sleep on it. Even after pointing out that the ceiling was leaking and would continue to wet the mattress, he coldly replied, “I don’t know, you have to sleep like that.”

The rooms are small and just enough to fit a double bed. If you're 3 people in one room then you'll be provided a mattress on the floor.
The AC in the room works well. The washroom is decent and there's 24/7 hot water. The staff is quite helpful.

The only problem I see people complaining about is how it's tough to get to this hotel.
Well... A simple solution to that is to simply not drive inside the street and get out of the taxi at the road just outside the street, near Azad Resturant, then it's just a matter of 3 mins walk to the hotel.

There's many mosques nearby, infact it is in a muslim neighbourhood which was important for me.
However, the area is also pretty dirty and smelly.

There's Azad and Good Luck restaurant at walking distance which fulfilled the need for a budget eat-out option. There's even the famous Shalimar restaurant about 2-3kms away. And another great fast food street near Shalimar, so it's a pretty amazing location, eating out wise.

Make up your mind before coming here, this isn't a 5 star hotel. It is a budget hotel with very basic amenities. So when on a budget vacation, you'll have a place to freshen up and sleep after coming back from a day-long touring around Mumbai.",2025-04-24T07:53:06.952125Z,4 months ago

mum144,mum144_r3,Pradeep Ballal,1,"Feedback on My Stay — Extremely Disappointed

I had a very disappointing experience during my recent stay at your hotel. Initially, when I booked through Treebo, the hospitality and service were good, but this time it was pathetic.

I had to wait nearly an hour for a single cup of tea, and even then, it was not served.

If you request room delivery, food is brought directly from the kitchen without proper covering.

I observed vegetables being cut with bare hands, without any gloves — highly unhygienic.

On Holi night at 10:30 PM, I called the reception to order food, and they casually informed me that the kitchen was closed and I should order from outside.

The hotel has no power backup. If the EB power goes, guests are expected to manage without electricity.

Used dinner plates placed outside the room remained uncollected for two days.

WiFi is pathetic — it disconnects over 10 times a day, and each time you have to reconnect manually.

Mobile network (Jio & Airtel) is extremely poor inside the room.

The rooms are infested with cockroaches. I complained to the reception multiple times, but no action was taken.

Overall, the service has dropped drastically, and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone unless these basic issues are addressed",2025-04-20T12:24:29.037225Z,4 months ago

I booked this hotel primarily for the Wi-Fi, but it didn’t work at all. Despite raising multiple complaints with the staff, no one made any effort to resolve the issue. When I reached out to MakeMyTrip customer care, I was rudely questioned for even contacting them. I had no option but to check out within 3 hours.
The hotel is located in a shady, unsafe area.
The rooms are in terrible condition — stained bedsheets, foul smell, tiny bathrooms, and absolutely no sense of hygiene.
During checkout, a staff member named Askar assured me of a partial refund once the payment reached their bank. But when I followed up, he backtracked, claiming the owner (Sheikh) refused the refund and even refused to speak with me.

mum147,mum147_r1,I am that I am,1,"Security Alert!
I can only give this hotel one star. During my stay I accidentally left a shopping bag with several newly purchased items in my room. After check-out, I realized a few hours later that I had forgotten it and contacted the hotel — but by then the bag was found empty, containing only papers.

Importantly, after I checked out I waited in the lobby for about 45 minutes for my friend. From the lobby sofa, I could see my room on the same floor. Housekeeping entered immediately, and I personally witnessed bed sheets and other items being placed outside the room. It is very likely that the cleaner discovered my forgotten shopping bag, but even though I was still in the hotel, no one reported it to me.

The management claims to have reviewed the CCTV footage, but apparently never questioned the staff who cleaned the room right after my departure. This only deepens the suspicion surrounding how the items disappeared. Serious concerns remain about guest security and accountability.

Yes, breakfast was excellent and the location is convenient. However, none of that matters if belongings can simply vanish inside the hotel without explanation. The room also lacked proper cleanliness, and the outdated electrical plugs were loose and unsafe.

Very disappointing and unacceptable for a hotel with such high ratings. Think twice before trusting this place with your belongings. Guests staying multiple nights should be especially careful and keep a close watch on their possessions.",2025-08-22T03:11:20.524646623Z,2 weeks ago

The large beam was at 5 ft tall so you had to duck under it, but it was very well padded for when I went my head the middle of the night.  Lastly, they provide a container of safe drinking water in your room everyday which was a really nice touch. I'd highly suggest staying here.",2025-06-07T23:16:19.422985Z,3 months ago

1. I booked a room two months in advance for 3 weeks. When I reached the hotel I was told there are no rooms available. The receptionist made it sound like my fault for not having called him the previous day. ( I DID CALL HIM THE PREVIOUS DAY TO CONFIRM THE BOOKING AND HE DID. HE EVEN SENT ME A WHATSAPP MSG OF THE SAME.)

2. The area is extremely shady. There were about 7-8 men standing right outside the entrance door staring at us (2 women) from top to bottom. It was utterly uncomfortable.

3. I happened to see a room. The room was worse than a tiny servant quarters that fits just one bed and that’s about it. The room was dirty. The mattress didn’t have a cover on and the bathroom was not even big enough for a thin person to stand in.

The rooms are not at all similar to what they show in the pictures. The location itself is not worth staying near the railway station.

I’m in an all India trip and have stayed in way better places at even cheaper prices.

They charged around 1800 inclusive of parking here and yet the money charged is not at par to the services.

Plus quick note: they have tenure from BMC and buy the parking spots on annual basis, and charge 200 per every customer incase they require parking… and hotels do the same in that lane.

You can park and tell them you don’t have a car, there is no one to check which car is from which hotel. They just make a scene and it’s a way they loot the customers.

Plus since near the station a lot of loading and unloading of goods happen throughout the day.

Not a place worth staying with family.

Also the free BREAKFAST IS A JOKE. Just a way they loot money. IT WAS AWEFUL!!!
