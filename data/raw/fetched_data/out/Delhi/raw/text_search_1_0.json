The hotel itself is beautiful, with a great location. It\u2019s clean, the rooms are lovely, and from a physical and design standpoint, it meets the standard of what you\u2019d expect from a luxury property.\n\nBut sadly, my experience was affected by the service, particularly from the restaurant staff. I want to be fair hotel staff around the world are usually warm, professional, and kind. But during my stay, I couldn\u2019t ignore how I was treated, especially compared to other guests. Being a person of color, I felt I was treated differently, and that feeling was hard to shake. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cultural issue or something else, but it was clear that white guests were given noticeably better service.\n\nOne example: I was seated at breakfast at a table that still had dirty glasses and utensils from a previous guest. No one came to clean it or offer fresh cutlery. Meanwhile, a white guest seated right before me was shown to a fully set, clean table without delay. That kind of disparity is hard to overlook, especially in a hotel that calls itself five-star.\n\nExperiencing this type of treatment made me feel uncomfortable and, frankly, discriminated against. It\u2019s disappointing, because this hotel has so much potential but service like that falls far below the standard that should come with the rating and price tag.\n\nIf The Lalit wants to be a truly world-class hotel, it needs to ensure all guests are treated with equal respect and dignity regardless of skin color or nationality.\n\nIt prides itself in being LGBT Friendly, I am part of that community, Not because you employ LGBT individuals means you are respectful and professional. Its a shame BUT I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN OR never RECOMMEND ANYONE too",

The room key card didn\u2019t work 2 days in a row, the first day we were told to keep it away from phones and electronics and we did that still the second day, same problem! After an entire day of sightseeing, you finally approach your room to crash, only to find out that you need to go back down again to activate your card.

Breakfast had a wide selection of food. During our stay, we were also offered free light meal for one family member who got sick. The staff was also helpful in keeping some medicines which required cold refrigeration. It was my sister's birthday and we were surprised that the hotel gave a nice birthday cake. The only thing which is think requires improvement is the turn around time when we require something in the room. For example we asked for iron and ironing board or cutlery and this took time to be delivered to our rooms. However, we will definitely stay at the Park again. thank you.",

And it had all the basic amenities required.\nThe Cafe Pride and Oriental Spice restaurant are nice and spacious and serve delicious food. And offer  well spread and extensive buffet breakfast and dinner with numerous options to satisfy your taste buds. Though it gets a bit crowded during breakfast time and one must wait to get a table during the peak breakfast time.\nThe conference halls are spacious and are well equipped. However, the issue of mosquitoes is there in the conference hall though they did try to take care of the same by still this needs to be taken care of by the Hotel Management\nThe retail outlets of Aerocity are just round the corner of the exit of the Hotel and one can go there for shopping and also enjoy ambience and the food at the various outlets located in the vicinity.\nOverall it was a pleasant stay at the Pride Plaza Hotel and might stay again.",

Made a booking thru booking.com and had requested early check in well in advance over call and in writing from the property  which I totally understand was subject to availability. The standard time was 3.00 pm. but instead they gave an exhausted me the room with amenities mentioned in booking, close to 4 pm and that too as if they were doing a favor. Not mentioning names here but some of the front desk staff were appallingly haughty. A select few did extend genuine help. There were two things I specifically noticed about this place: I asked for two room keys (even if one of them deactivated) so I can keep the lights on for my child in room, in case I needed to step out for a wee bit, but they wouldnt give it as if I were asking for a treasure. Asked me to  'come back later' for it. Then I specifically noticed a bias in which they were sweet to foreigners and would happily let them check out with just a key drop but made us stand for long, for check out because they were 'checking our rooms' despite handing them card details and reporting minibar usage upfront. Why do not these people understand that business they get through people is what pays their salary irrespectively and that they are not there to judge or discriminate but render services and equally so? Upon complaining, they did give me extended check out hours, a complimentary cab to airport and a promise to upgrade to suite next time but will there be a next time now? Does this payment undo our distasteful  experience? Raddison is not a one night stand hotel but a dignified name.They should stop giving preferential treatment to customers of their choice and render services they have promised. Or maybe, just stop overcommitting.The management needs to train employees better in handling customer needs and esp do something about their biased behaviour. Customer's satisfaction and loyalty are not bought by hand outs but warm welcome, a comfortable stay and a stress free check out. So, I'm thoroughly disappointed.",

I had already travelled two flights (super tired) and wanted a place to freshen up and stretch my legs a bit. I also requested for a room with table and chair so I could send out some emails meanwhile.\nWhen I arrived, I was given a Rs.2000 booking for 3 and a half hrs, so I hoped it was going to be a comfortable stay. To my surprise, they gave me a really shoddy looking room, with extremely small space and it smelt bad! I'm damp allergic so I smelt it right away, also, the room wasn't deep cleaned.\nI called the reception immediately and challenged their choice of room for Rs.2000 (only for a few hrs). They then shifted me to a bigger room, with enough walk space and it wasn't smelling bad, either. Which means, they could've given me that room in the first go, but they tried their luck with a tiny room (which could've costed way less for 3hrs).\nI ordered food, which was in good quantity but the quality was average. I wasn't expecting a lot, so no complaints there.\nBut, I couldn't really bring myself to use the bathroom for a shower or change clothes to sleep for even an hour! I just went in with the same clothing and napped for, what could've been a 10-15 mins, only.\n\nThe hotel admin and heads should really work on these things, because there are plenty of hotels around as a competition and the last thing a customer would want to fight about is the value for money and cleanliness. I was more concerned about getting a good rest, which obviously wasn't possible here.\nMoreover, I also felt that being a single person (a girl) coming with her luggage was enough for them to assume that I will be OKAY with whatever they gave me.\nWell.. sorry to disappoint you.\nI won't be coming back again and wouldn't recommend anybody to stay here as well.

The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was spacious.\nHowever, there were a couple of drawbacks that prevented me from giving a higher rating. Firstly, the cleanliness of the room could have been better. There were some dust and stains on the furniture and floor.\n\nSecondly, the fan in the room was quite noisy, which made it difficult to sleep at night. I had to switch it off, which made the room a bit warm. So make sure you get a good room before check-in.\n\nWe had breakfast and dinner at this hotel. The breakfast was freshly cooked and served on the table however there was a big letdown at dinner. Their 400rs biryani was not worth it.  The food seems to be more stale and insipid. We didn't like it at all. So I won't recommend having dinner here.\n\nDespite these issues, I would still recommend Hotel Royal Inn IGI to travelers looking for a convenient and affordable place to stay. With a bit of improvement in cleanliness and maintenance, this hotel could be a real gem.",

The hotel is incredibly convenient if you have any consular or visa-related work \u2014 the VAC center was literally walkable, right near Shivaji Stadium metro station where all the major VFS centers are located. That alone makes it an ideal stay for anyone coming to Delhi for that purpose.\n\nWhile it\u2019s on the higher end in terms of pricing, it\u2019s totally worth it. In fact, I felt like I got more than what I paid for. The service was excellent \u2014 warm, attentive, and professional \u2014 and the overall experience had a premium feel to it.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, though, was the view from my room. I had a direct view of Jantar Mantar \u2014 one of Delhi\u2019s iconic historical landmarks. That kind of view really speaks volumes about the hotel\u2019s location, right in the heart of the city.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t write this review without mentioning the butter chicken pizza. Yes, butter chicken pizza! It was so unbelievably delicious that I ordered it again the next day. Having lived in the U.S. and tried some amazing pizza spots on the East Coast, I can still say this was one of the best pizzas I\u2019ve ever had. Funny enough, I also tried a classic butter chicken with naan later, and it didn\u2019t match up to that pizza. There was something special about that dish \u2014 a perfect fusion of Indian flavors and Western comfort food.\n\nThis was my first visit to Delhi, and staying at The Park made it all the more memorable. Highly recommended for business, leisure, or visa-related travel. Great location, great hospitality, and yes \u2014 unforgettable food!",

The rooms were modern, well-designed, and impeccably clean, providing a peaceful oasis after a long day of travel or exploration. The comfortable bed and blackout curtains ensured a restful night's sleep, and the soundproofing eliminated any outside noise, allowing me to relax and unwind in tranquility.\n\nThe highlight of my experience was undoubtedly the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. They were attentive, courteous, and genuinely committed to making my stay memorable.

The breakfast buffet featured a wide variety of delicious dishes, catering to different dietary preferences. The food was of excellent quality, and the attentive staff made sure that all guests were well taken care of. Additionally, the hotel's restaurant offered a diverse menu for lunch and dinner, with dishes that were both flavorsome and beautifully presented.\n\nOverall, my stay at ibis New Delhi Aerocity exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

The ambiance was luxurious, with tasteful decor that exuded sophistication. The staff were exceptionally friendly and went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable experience.\n\nThe room was impeccably clean, and the attention to detail was evident in every aspect. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, providing a restful night's sleep. The amenities were top-notch, from the well-stocked minibar to the luxurious toiletries in the bathroom.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were a culinary delight. The on-site restaurant offered a diverse menu, showcasing a fusion of flavors that catered to various palates. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive, featuring a wide array of fresh and delicious options.\n\nThe location of Luxe Haven is also worth mentioning. Conveniently situated near popular attractions and with easy access to public transportation, it made exploring the city hassle-free.\n\nOverall, my experience at Luxe Haven was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of attentive staff, luxurious accommodations, and delectable dining made for a memorable stay.
