A staff member (appeared to be a manager) rudely yelled at us once he realized we were from the event, saying we weren't allowed in that area.\n\nNo place to work: I had an urgent office call and couldn\u2019t find a place to sit in the event area. When I moved to the garden, security asked me to leave. At the reception area, I was forced to sit on the floor. Staff kept rudely shooing us away without suggesting a proper spot to work from.\n\nInadequate facilities: Only one washroom was available for a large crowd. It became dirty quickly, with no prompt cleaning. Paint was peeling in several areas, which was surprising for a hotel of this stature.\n\nFor a premium hotel hosting corporate guests, the lack of courtesy, basic amenities, and professionalism was very disappointing.",

A staff member (appeared to be a manager) rudely yelled at us once he realized we were from the event, saying we weren't allowed in that area.\n\nNo place to work: I had an urgent office call and couldn\u2019t find a place to sit in the event area. When I moved to the garden, security asked me to leave. At the reception area, I was forced to sit on the floor. Staff kept rudely shooing us away without suggesting a proper spot to work from.\n\nInadequate facilities: Only one washroom was available for a large crowd. It became dirty quickly, with no prompt cleaning. Paint was peeling in several areas, which was surprising for a hotel of this stature.\n\nFor a premium hotel hosting corporate guests, the lack of courtesy, basic amenities, and professionalism was very disappointing.",

On calling the service center, the first housekeeping staff walked in completely clueless and uninterested. His supervisor, Umesh, casually told me to \u201ccheck with the front desk\u201d if I wanted a room change something I never expected to hear at Shangri-La, where hospitality has always been seamless.\n\nIt only went further downhill. When Pavan came to assist us with moving bags to the other room, he literally made a face at us, banged the door, and walked away  a level of rudeness that was simply shocking for a brand like this. Breakfast was equally chaotic. All we asked for was a takeaway, only to be brushed off by a staff member who pointed us to another counter while standing in front of a whole stack himself.\n\nAt checkout, Laqshay didn\u2019t bother to ask about our stay or invite feedback perhaps because they already know how poor the experience is. all we got was a flat, meaningless \u201csorry.\u201d\n\nOverall, this stay was charmless, careless, and a complete waste of time. For a brand built on warmth and world-class hospitality, Shangri-La has truly failed this time.",

The food here is literally the best I\u2019ve ever had at a hotel \u2013 so good that it actually runs out sometimes because of how popular it is. Their in-house restaurant, Cosmo, is an absolute highlight. Every meal felt freshly prepared, full of flavor, and way above what you\u2019d usually expect from hotel dining.\n\nWhat really stood out besides the food was the staff. They were extremely friendly and genuinely welcoming from the moment I checked in. You don\u2019t always see that level of warmth and consistency in hotels, but here it felt natural and sincere. They really took extreme care of guests, making sure everything was smooth and comfortable throughout my stay.\n\nOverall, Hyatt Centric Hebbal sets the bar really high, from the outstanding food at Cosmo to the incredible hospitality of the staff.

Swimming pool was clean and nice, ideal to relax after hard day of work or sightseeing and the spa was utterly rejuvenating experience of professional care and tranquil surroundings.

The staff is extremely well-trained, courteous, and reflects a culture built on strong values, which really enhances the overall guest experience.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, comfortable, and beautifully maintained. The front office team was very helpful and professional, while the kitchen team deserves special mention for the delightful dining experience \u2014 the breakfast spread was absolutely superb!\n\nThe hotel\u2019s surroundings are wonderful, and its prime location makes it very convenient.

I noticed that some cleaning staff were really awesome and did their jobs very sincerely, which made a positive impression. The atmosphere in the hotel was pleasant, and the morning live music truly made my day musically happy.\n\nNice infinity swimming pool which is again pleasing. Good Gym area with spa and sauna, which is really relaxing. The different aroma of oils\nPulls you in the massage room, which is also again very relaxing and soothing.\n\nI love the music in the lift with the perfect volume. Great job on that.\n\nWhile my stay was good and the people were very helpful, I did notice that some rooms could use renovation. However, I really appreciated the breakfast lounge with the buffet; it was a great start to my day, especially with the delightful music.\n\nOverall, my experience was all good, and I look forward to returning in the future.

            "text": "recently stayed at JW Marriott in Bengaluru for a week with my leadership team for a business conference. While my overall stay and hospitality was warm and welcoming, there were some surprising lapses in service that I wouldn\u2019t have expected from a brand of this caliber!!!\n\nThe highlights? The little touches that made me feel at home. Payal from JW Kitchen greeted me every morning with a warm smile and recognized my room number by my face. Athili, the lovely housekeeper, did a fresh flower d\u00e9cor on my bed each day and created the most soothing turndown tub service after long workdays. Dinesh from the concierge went above and beyond by bringing me medication when I wasn\u2019t feeling well - even though I had only requested for a cup of cumin seeds. The AYS team was consistently responsive and polite. Laasya from Guest Relations made my day with a sweet JW note and treat for being a Bonvoy member. Sakthi from the wellness center took care of us with genuine kindness during facility maintenance. And Abhishek from housekeeping was always warm and engaging in our interactions!!\n\nOther favorites from my stay included the fantastic breakfast spread, the well-equipped wellness center, pool, and gym, and the beautiful view of Cubbon Park from my room\u2019s balcony. The smiling restaurant staff, who patiently served me without a single frown, truly elevated my experience, and I really appreciate each and everyone from the F&Brb team! They did a fabulous job!!!!\n\nHowever, there were some aspects that fell short. One day, I returned to my room and found a small dead roach inside a paper bag of breakfast bread I had packed and accidentally left behind. While I can\u2019t say for sure whether it came from the kitchen or the room, it was alarming. Housekeeping was inconsistent with some basic stuffs like one of the trash bins left uncleared, the kettle not cleaned for nearly five days, and essentials like water bottles and glasses were sometimes not restocked. I ignored these, thinking they were one-time misses, but it began to feel like a recurring pattern. At breakfast one day, my simple request for a one-egg cheese masala omelette with chicken sausages got messed up - twice!!!\n\nOne particularly disappointing experience was when I arranged a surprise room decoration for the son of our company\u2019s COO (who was also staying there). I had clearly asked the GRM, Sanchita, to inform me once the guests had stepped out before starting the decoration - but she didn\u2019t. The surprise was mishandled. Karan, the RDM, made a kind gesture to redo the setup in another room and added our gift, which I truly appreciated. However, neither he nor the original GRM followed up with me or met me afterward. Sanchita, in particular, didn\u2019t acknowledge the oversight or offer a sincere apology, and I truly feel that she doesn't have the eye for detail that a GRM should have!!\n\nDespite all this, I want to highlight that many team members were truly exceptional - their warmth, smiles, and willingness to go the extra mile made parts of my stay genuinely memorable. But at a JW Marriott, I do expect the basics to be non-negotiable: clean and well-serviced rooms, consistent housekeeping, and accurate attention to guest requests. That\u2019s what defines luxury!!\n\nI hope this feedback helps the team improve and better align guest experiences with the high standards JW is known for!\n\nWould I return? Possibly yes - or maybe not!!! Only time can tell that!!",

The food was absolutely top-notch \u2014 each dish beautifully presented, flavorful, Whether it was the rich Indian delicacies, the globally-inspired dishes, or the decadent desserts, everything surpassed expectations. The ambiance is elegant yet inviting, and the service (once seated) was warm and attentive.\n\nHowever, I do feel compelled to highlight one recurring issue: reservations. Despite booking in advance, our table wasn\u2019t ready on arrival, and we had to wait significantly past our reservation time. For a hotel of this caliber, better reservation management would go a long way in improving the overall guest experience.\n\nThat said, the food more than made up for the initial hiccup.

It\u2019s a short walk to common areas but there are golf carts if needed and the greenery adds to the charm. Since its heritage there are no elevators to the individual buildings which are G+1, so just be mindful of booking ground floor rooms only when booking for elderly or people with mobility issues. The food is good and the breakfast is well thought out. It can get a bit chaotic when it is full house like over the long weekend.\nSpecial mention to our housekeeping staff Therthei, who worked alone and was super efficient in getting our room tidy for us always. The duty manager also was kind in offering to switch our room and offered us some treats in the room when we complained about a minor noise issue. We chose to decline the change in room eventually but we do appreciate these little gestures and over all would come back for a little slice of peace in the bustle of the city.",

You can tell they want to provide good service, and the property maintains the luxury feel you'd expect from the Taj brand.\nThe Issues:\nUnfortunately, while the staff excel at pleasantries, they seem to struggle with proper room preparation and issue resolution. Upon arrival, our room had empty shower gel dispensers and a non-functioning TV - basic amenities that should have been checked before handing over the room to guests, especially given the hotel's star rating.\nWhile the shower gel issue was resolved immediately when I mentioned it, it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. A hotel of this caliber should have proper housekeeping checks to ensure rooms are guest-ready.\nMore concerning was the TV problem. Despite raising this with multiple staff members throughout my 3-day stay and receiving repeated assurances that it would be \"looked into,\" the issue was never resolved. It's baffling how a premier property can fail to address such a straightforward maintenance issue.\nBottom Line:\nFor a property that positions itself as premium hospitality, basic room preparation oversights and inability to handle guest requests are unacceptable.

She was fantastic \u2014 offering us an early check-in, a late check-out, and complete support throughout our time there. What stood out most was her personal touch \u2014 she came all the way to our car to bid us farewell, which truly reflects her warm and thoughtful character.\n\nThe wide spread of the buffet breakfast was impressive, and the restaurant staff were absolutely outstanding. The food was delicious, and a special mention goes to the freshly served sugarcane juice \u2014 it was simply exceptional!",

Every team member we encountered went above and beyond to make our stay unforgettable, and some truly deserve special recognition.\n\nWe walked into the hotel and were warmly greeted by an incredible young woman, Farzana, (who also happens to be the Front Office Manager). Farzana personally organized our check-in process, transforming what could have been a complicated situation into an effortless experience. I can hardly put into words how unforgettable she made our stay. Her friendly demeanor, infectious smile, bubbly personality, and boundless enthusiasm shone through in every interaction we had with her. It\u2019s clear that Farzana loves her job and is genuinely committed to ensuring every guest has a perfect stay. By the time we left, she had made us feel like part of her family. In fact, she went so far as to come in on her day off to personally oversee our check-out! Farzana left an indelible mark on our hearts and truly made this trip extraordinary.\n\nAnother standout was Sarvajith, the manager of the hotel\u2019s 3 restaurants. A casual breakfast conversation about cooking lessons turned into a unique culinary experience. Sarvajith took time out of his busy schedule to arrange this for us for the same afternoon.\n\nHe introduced us to Chef Murugesan, who patiently taught us to make appam, dosa, sambhar, and the potato masala filling. His tips, tricks, and kindness made the session memorable\u2014and the next morning, he surprised us with an incredible platter of dosas at breakfast! Absolutely delicious and we devoured them!\n\nTeerth also deserves a shoutout for arranging a spectacular high tea that turned into a delightful feast.\n\nEvery interaction during our stay was filled with warmth, care, and impeccable service. The Ritz-Carlton Bangalore is more than a luxurious destination; it\u2019s a place where the staff turn a visit into a cherished memory.\n\nI don\u2019t usually write reviews, but this experience demanded one.\n\nBravo to the team for delivering not just a stay but an unforgettable experience!",

            "text": "Unwelcome Treatment: Discrimination at Ritz Carlton Bangalore\n\nYesterday, I, along with my team of 12, visited Ritz Carlton with high expectations for a delightful dining experience. As a passionate food blogger and traveller, I was eager to capture the essence of The Market restaurant through my lens and share it with my audience. However, what unfolded was nothing short of a disgraceful display of discrimination that left us utterly upset.\nBefore even setting foot in The Market, we were rudely confronted by an Operations Manager named Jocelyn Vaz. With an air of superiority, he demanded that I switch off my camera and forbade any form of video recording. To add insult to injury, he then instructed his subordinate to monitor our every move, as if we were criminals plotting some wicked act. This humiliating experience was witnessed by my entire team, leaving me insulted in from of my team ad us feeling sidelined and disrespected.\nDespite my attempt to address this issue personally with Jocelyn, the damage had already been done. It was only through the intervention of the Restaurant in charge, Mr. Sunil Kumar, that we received an acknowledgment for Jocelyn's inappropriate behaviour. While his apology was appreciated, it hardly compensated for the marked experience we suffered.\nThe incident at Ritz Carlton made us feel like unwelcome outsiders, unworthy of the same treatment as other guests. No number of regretful words can undo the sense of humiliation and disappointment that overshadowed what should have been a memorable dining experience. We had hoped for a good evening and hospitality, but instead, we were met with discrimination and disregard.\n\nMoving forward, it is with great reluctance that we vow not to visit Ritz Carlton again. Our hard-earned money and loyalty deserve to be appreciated, not met with prejudice and hostility. It's disheartening to see such behaviour tolerated in a renowned establishment like Ritz Carlton.\n\nI've had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience hospitality from some of the world's finest establishments, including Taj, Leela, The Oberoi, ITC, Four Seasons, and many others. Never have I encountered such disrespectful treatment. Even at 3-star and 4-star hotels where I've been personally invited, I've been greeted warmly, served by chefs, and offered premium accommodations with breathtaking views for me and my family. Unfortunately, the damage has been done, and this negative experience at Ritz Carlton stands out starkly against the backdrop of exceptional hospitality I've enjoyed elsewhere.\n\nI must take a moment to express my gratitude to Miss Rajshree Buragohain for her efforts in arranging our space and providing exceptional service. Thank you, Rajshree.",

Situated in the very heart of the city, this iconic hotel effortlessly combines luxury, elegance, and impeccable service.\n\nThe sprawling grounds of Taj West End create an oasis of tranquility amidst the urban hustle, offering a sense of serenity that is rare in the midst of a bustling city. The lush greenery, meticulously landscaped gardens, and the timeless architecture of the hotel set the stage for a truly regal experience.\n\nThe wedding celebration was hosted with utmost grace and sophistication. The event spaces at Taj West End exude opulence, providing the perfect backdrop for the joyous occasion. The attention to detail in the decor and arrangements was impeccable, reflecting the hotel's commitment to creating memorable experiences.\n\nWhat truly sets Taj West End apart is the exemplary service. The staff's dedication to ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of the guests is evident in every interaction. From the warm welcome at the entrance to the flawless execution of the wedding festivities, the service surpassed all expectations.\n\nThe central location of Taj West End adds to its allure. Despite being in the heart of the city, once within the hotel's premises, one feels transported to a world of luxury and refinement. It's a testament to the hotel's ability to seamlessly blend the vibrancy of the city with the tranquility of a five-star retreat.\n\nIn conclusion, Taj West End is more than just a hotel; it's a haven of luxury in the midst of the city's pulse. My recent visit for my friend's wedding was a delightful experience, and I can't commend the hotel enough for its exquisite ambiance, top-notch service, and central location. A solid 5/5, and highly recommended for those seeking a touch of grandeur in Bangalore.",

From the outset, the staff's warmth and courtesy set a welcoming tone, turning my visit into a truly memorable experience.\n\nIn response to my request for an early check-in, Hyatt Centric not only accommodated it seamlessly but also ensured my room was ready upon arrival, establishing a precedent for the exceptional service that followed. The thoughtful recommendation of ground floor-garden facing rooms, catering to my family's needs and providing easy access to the gaming zone and pool area, exemplified the hotel's meticulous attention to detail.\n\nThroughout my stay, the staff consistently delivered prompt and top-notch service, underscoring their dedication to guest satisfaction. An aspect that particularly stood out was the proactive engagement of the staff in enhancing my overall experience. One staff member took the initiative to inquire about my interests and suggested a list of tourist spots to visit. This personal touch, where the staff volunteered and actively contributed to itinerary planning, was truly touching. It was a rare and delightful experience, as I haven't often encountered staff members proactively offering suggestions and assisting with planning. This level of engagement added an extra layer of personalization to my stay, showcasing the staff's genuine commitment to ensuring guests make the most of their time in Goa.\n\nThe culinary journey at Hyatt Centric continued to impress, with a diverse menu and exquisite preparations that catered to various tastes. The hotel's prime location further enhanced the overall appeal, providing easy access to Goa's vibrant attractions.\n\nIn conclusion, Hyatt Centric not only delivered luxurious accommodation but also excelled in personalized service that went above and beyond. The combination of seamless early check-in, family-friendly recommendations, meticulous attention to detail, and proactive staff engagement demonstrated the hotel's dedication to ensuring an unforgettable experience for every guest. I wholeheartedly recommend Hyatt Centric to fellow travelers seeking a perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and genuine hospitality in the heart of Goa.",

We had a memorable stay, right from checkin till we checked out we had a great experience.\n\nIt's a horse themed hotel as it's adjacent to the race course. Our suite had a beautiful view of the race course.\n\nThe staff is very courteous, warm and always attentive to guests' needs. We enjoyed the food at Lush as well as at the bar lounge. Being a long weekend the restaurant was almost full during breakfast but we didn't have to wait for our orders and we received the same kind of personal attention which usually happens when the restaurants aren't full.\n\nSpecial thanks to house keeping staff for taking extra effort to make us feel special.\n\nOur last visit was within a few months of hotel's inauguration and it's really amazing to see the high standards being maintained in terms of their hospitality, food and overall guest experience.\n\nWe Would love to visit again sometime soon",
