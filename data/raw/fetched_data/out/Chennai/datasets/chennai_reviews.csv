che001,che001_r1,Aishwarya Acharya,4,"Stayed @ ITC Grand Chola for 4N/5D during July 2025 while on a business trip to Chennai.

Impressed by the grand architecture, property amenities (600+ rooms, services apartments, many restaurants with specialised cuisine, swimming pool, spa, lounge, wellness centre / gym, etc.), sprawling lawns, spacious rooms, artisanal ice-cream place, fabelle chocolates store and courteous staff!
There were multiple specialty restaurants from Indian to Pan Asian, Indian, Italian, and more.

On all the 5 days, the breakfast buffet was a highlight-lavish, well-balanced with South/North Indian and Western options. The dinner spread, while decent, leaned more heavily on Indian options.

One suggestion: While items are clearly labelled with allergen info, I expected clearer separation between vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, especially for people with allergies. For instance, pancakes (with egg) and eggless waffles were placed side by side, with a shared serving tong - increases cross contamination risks. As someone with a severe egg allergy, this was very concerning for me. While the staff always prepared fresh waffles for me on request, the arrangement / layout of dishes didnt change over the 5 days I had breakfast - i expect better allergen awareness and caution from a luxury property.

Special mention to Sayantan @ front desk for a smooth experience, Susmita for her personal touch / calls about my experience, Abhisek who served us (during dinner on 7/10). Thanks team!

Overall, it was a memorable stay - but a bit more attention to detail and timely accommodation of guest requests would elevate the experience further!",2025-07-13T12:32:54.050690927Z,a month ago

The hotel provided complimentary banana chips made in coconut oil which were really nice. Service was excellent. Swimming pool and gym facilities were well kept.
Was here for an office event. Food services were decent, beverages were really good.

che001,che001_r3,Addagulla saikumar,5,"My stay at ITC Grand Chola in Chennai was an exceptional experience, marked by luxury, comfort, and world-class hospitality. The rooms were truly opulent spacious, elegantly designed, and equipped with every modern amenity one could ask for. From the plush bedding to the high-tech in-room controls, every detail reflected attention to luxury and convenience. The blend of traditional South Indian architecture with contemporary touches made the space feel both grand and welcoming.

One of the absolute highlights of my stay was the food. Every meal was a culinary delight. The variety and richness of flavors across their multiple in-house restaurants were simply outstanding. Whether it was the lavish South Indian breakfast spread, authentic Chettinad cuisine, or the perfectly cooked international dishes, everything was fresh, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. The service at the dining venues was equally impeccable warm, attentive, and knowledgeable staff who went out of their way to make sure we had the best experience.

The overall ambience of the property from the stunning lobby to the serene pool area and grand corridors exudes elegance. It’s clear that this hotel doesn’t just provide accommodation but a luxurious experience rooted in Indian hospitality.

The breakfast offerings are exceptional.  Sadly  noticing a deterioration in staff responsiveness and demeanor. Perhaps the hotel is now too busy, the receptionist rarely connect or have a smile.

ITC Grand Chola is a true luxury property with a grand presence. While the rooms offered comfort, the ambience felt somewhat subdued due to the dark-colored furniture and décor, which made it a bit challenging to fully relax.

On the culinary front, the experience was truly exceptional. The dining options were remarkable, and we thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful, finger-licking dishes that ITC Hotels are renowned for. Overall, a memorable stay with standout dining experiences, though the room ambience could benefit from a lighter, more relaxing touch.",2025-08-24T10:05:35.534786740Z,a week ago
che002,che002_r1,P Sekar,5,"One of a few 7 star hotels in Chennai. Located near the sea, the ambience is quiet and relaxing. Maintenance is very good and as a customer we cannot ask for more. The staff need to be given some orientation and detailing of day-to-day activities so that customers are not left searching. Special instructions should be given to staff to address the questions of customers who look ""simple"" and are not ""so informed"". Food quality of South Indian dishes is ok. Needs  improvement to meet the standards of gourmets. :) Parking is plenty and the drivers are helpful.",2025-07-18T04:01:01.840895278Z,a month ago

Ambiance of the hotel is very very good .
Location is very convenient and not that far from the Airport and it is well connected by almost all mode of public transportation.
In the case of early departure ,we were given breakfast parcel by 7 am @ very short notice on previous evening.

Suggestion to the hotel management :

(1) To avoid any mishap ,especially to the Senior Citizen guests ,it will be better if steel bar is conveniently  fixed in the bathroom cum fresh room .
(2) As the Women  Hostel is there in front of the hotel , to maintain the privacy ,if will be better if the thick  curtains with the linings ,are fitted instead of  not that thick curtains already fitted .

No help with luggage, even during check-in or check-out. What made it worse was the rude and unhelpful reception staff — zero customer service.

Many options for food and drinks as they had about three restaurants within. Breakfast and dinner spread was so varied and widespread; great choices for non vegetarians (their mutton curry with thosai was amazing ) that which we did not enjoy in other hotels that we stayed on our two week trip to Trichy, Pondicherry, Goa and Cochin. Chennai GRT outdid even the Taj Fort Aquada in Goa by leaps and bounds in every aspect; service, ambience, rooms, fast lifts, food and driver’s parking.
As for service we wish to mention:
Kathir , Restaurant Manager & Sathish, Senior Executive, who were ever so attentive to both my husband every time  we were in the restaurant for our meals. My husband, who is English, wasn’t familiar with the various Indian dishes and had his preferences but they were so caring and ensured his every request was catered to. It is senior management such as them who enhance the experience for us customers and keep us coming back.
We want to thank Aparajita, Reception Staff who checked us in so smoothly and gave a few gift cards to enjoy in the hotel. Aparajita even walked us to the room to ensure it met with our comfort.She was very engaging, soft spoken, charming and stopped to check on us any time she met us in the foyer.
All in all we hardly had any meals outside of this hotel as hygiene was our priority and GRT, Chennai met that. If we visit Chennai again, this definitely be where we will stay!

che010,che010_r4,Dr. B. R. Isharam,3,"Hotel Review: Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Five-Star Tag

I recently stayed at this hotel for two nights, expecting a true five-star experience based on its classification and pricing. Unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations in almost every aspect.

Despite the high price, the services and amenities felt more like a three-star property. There was no lounge area, no lawn space, and no spa, which are basic features you'd expect from any upscale hotel. The room itself was quite compact, and to make matters worse, the mini-fridge wasn’t working. I informed the staff two to three times, but it was never resolved during my stay.

Basic necessities were also missing—no hand towels were provided, and the food quality was subpar. The buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner lacked variety and taste, making dining a rather disappointing experience.

Overall, the hotel does not live up to its five-star status. With its limited amenities, lack of attention to guest concerns, and poor food quality, I would rate it more accurately as a three-star property. Definitely not worth the premium pricing.

Only good thing is behavior of staff, very polite and courteous.",2025-06-16T17:28:52.940899597Z,2 months ago

Its most significant advantage is its location, it is just a short walk or a 2-minute drive from the US Consulate and the Visa Application Center, making it incredibly convenient for visa-related work. The proximity reduces travel stress on the day of the appointment. The highlight is hotel’s clean and comfortable rooms, supportive and prompt staff, and good amenities such as spa services, pool, and on-site dining. The property’s ambience is modern yet welcoming, and the staff are known to be helpful, which can be especially comforting during a possibly tense visa trip. If you’re traveling for visa appointments, then i would say it’s “worth every money spent.”

I’m currently staying at Ilara Hotels & Spa, and honestly, it hasn’t been a comfortable experience, especially if you're here with family or friends.

We were told that for more than two people, the extra person could sleep in the living room on the sofa. But the living room has no fan or AC, which makes it extremely uncomfortable. The AC and faucet in our main room aren't working properly either.

When we raised these issues, the staff just asked us to adjust for the night, saying they might give us a different room the next day. But today, they’ve changed the story, saying all rooms are the same and only offering a fan as a fix.

We’ve ended up squeezing into one room, trying to manage without basic comfort. So far, it’s been disappointing. I wouldn't suggest this place if you're looking for a relaxed and hassle-free family stay.

Another disappointment: the “spa” mentioned in the hotel’s name is currently non-operational for the next two months. If you're booking with the expectation of a relaxing spa experience, you’ll be let down. The name is quite misleading in that sense.",2025-07-17T04:38:52.946178806Z,a month ago

1. The toilet closet was leaking after every flush. While the staff promptly shifted me to another room upon complaint, such issues shouldn't occur in a suite category room.
2. The A/C unit in the room was excessively noisy, indicating a need for proper maintenance and servicing to ensure dust-free, effective cooling.
3. Although the room size was spacious enough to accommodate three people, the room had a persistent unpleasant odor, which affected overall comfort.
4. The bed covers, pillow covers, window curtains, and even the towels had a stale and unpleasant odor. This suggests inadequate laundering or storage.
5. Water supply was disrupted in the middle of the night, and despite multiple calls to reception, no one responded. I had to report it in person to get it resolved.
6. During my three-night stay, no housekeeping staff approached to offer room cleaning or replenishment of basic consumables such as bottled water, toiletries, towels, or tea/milk refills. This lack of daily maintenance was disappointing.
7. The dress & shoe closet was not cleaned properly and did not have any hangers, making it unusable for organizing clothes/shoe during the stay.",2025-08-11T15:08:50.597238610Z,3 weeks ago

che019,che019_r2,Viswanathan Sinnappa,5,"I had an excellent stay at Taz Kamar Inn in Chennai. The hotel is located in the heart of T. Nagar, making it very convenient for shopping and getting around the city. Despite the busy area, the hotel itself is calm, clean, and well-maintained.

The room was spacious, neat, and equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. The facilities are modern and well-kept, and I truly appreciated the attention to cleanliness throughout the property.

What really made the experience special was the hospitality of the staff. Everyone was very kind, respectful, and attentive. A special thanks to Mr. Abdul Rauf, who went out of his way to make sure all our needs were taken care of. His helpful attitude, professionalism, and warm nature truly stood out and made our stay even more memorable.

Overall, I highly recommend Taz Kamar Inn to anyone visiting Chennai. Whether you’re here for shopping, business, or family visits, this hotel offers great comfort, value, and excellent service.",2025-08-04T15:01:57.736372134Z,a month ago

The towels were very dirty, had numerous stains and was brownish instead of white due to old age. The soap dispenser was faulty and the replacement never came even after requesting. The room service personnel were requested to clean and replace the towels and water bottles. However, they constantly did not replace these items. Furthermore, the Front Office Manager Mr Riyas was extremely rude and impolite when Ms Mahalechumi spoke with him over the phone. On the final day we checked out at 6am and when we requested for a discount since we were checking out almost half a day before the usual check out time and weren’t even taking breakfast, they denied a discount although the previous day we were told that there would be a discount.

che020,che020_r1,Ninad Joshi,5,"I recently stayed at The Accord Metropolitan in Chennai and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

Location:
The hotel is conveniently located right on the main road, adjacent to a flyover, making it easy to access from various parts of the city. Shops, restaurants, and essential stores are all close by, whatever you need is just a short walk away.

Rooms & Amenities:
The rooms are excellent. Even the standard category room is spacious and includes a bathtub, which is a rare offering these days. The room features a 50"" TV with OTT platforms already subscribed, a separate coffee table with two chairs, a dedicated work desk with an office chair, and two telephones viz. one near the bed and the other at the work desk.

The hotel provides all essential toiletries and accessories, along with thoughtful amenities like a bathrobe, slippers, iron with ironing board, hairdryer, and a mini bar. Everything is well maintained and neatly arranged.

Dining:
The property houses three restaurants. I tried the breakfast buffet and was amazed by the variety, so many options that I couldn't try everything even over a three-day stay! Each dish I tried was delicious and well-prepared.

On our first evening, we dined at OPM, one of the in-house restaurants. The service was prompt, and the staff was courteous. The food was excellent — especially the honey-glazed lotus stem starter, which was a unique and memorable dish for me. The ambience was elevated by live singing and soft music, creating a very pleasant dining experience.

The following evening, we visited the restaurant on the first floor. While the food was fine, the loud sound didn’t suit our mood, so we didn’t stay long.

Facilities:
I used the gym and swimming pool, which were well-maintained. I couldn’t try the spa, sauna, or steam room this time — but those are definitely on my list for the next visit.

Final Thoughts:
Overall, The Accord Metropolitan offers a great blend of location, comfort, service, and dining. I highly recommend it for both business and leisure travelers.

Thanks for reading! Feel free to check out the photos and do like and follow for more reviews.",2025-07-19T05:36:06.184831775Z,a month ago

Hospitality of the staff at the hotel was amazing.  Staff at the hotel did not say no to any of our requests.
They arranged for medicine for my daughter in the middle of night for my daughter.  And I am really grateful to them for that.
One day for breakfast we needed Jain Sambar and they quickly got that made for us and best part is that they remembered this request even the next day even when the hotel was completely booked.  I just had breakfast at the hotel and it was delicious and satisfying.
We were gifted a nice souvenir on check out.  Unfortunately, my daughter did not get the toy they generally give as a souvenir but they eventually were happy with the souvenir.

A shout out to all the staff members at the hotel. Sadly I do not remember name of all the staff members but Santhiya G, who had been very kind and helpful with checkout formalities.",2025-03-25T01:04:05.211132Z,5 months ago

che022,che022_r1,shreya ananth,1,"1. We asked for cold water to be brought to our room. No one showed up. So we called the reception 4 times. Every time someone said that they’ve informed the staff and some is bringing it up right now. No one showed up for 30 minutes. 30 minutes later, we get a call and are told that there is no cold water. This could’ve been done initially. But we simply asked for an ice bucket. No one showed up again. Then a staff showed but with regular bottle. We asked him to bring an ice bucket. We were in a hurry. We had to head out: we only delayed our departure because we were waiting for cold water. But we couldn’t delay it anymore. Then the staff assured me that he will bring the ice bucket immediately because I made him aware of the urgency. No one showed up yet again for another 10 minutes. So now we headed out. All we wanted was a bottle of cold water on a hot day because we didn’t have a bottle of water in the fridge in our room.
2. The creamer and coffee was not replenished when the room was cleaned.

All in all the service was poor. For the price that you seek, it’s not worth it at all. I wouldn’t book my stay here again",2025-08-05T09:50:36.439261838Z,a month ago

We honestly would not have stayed here if we'd known it would be this ridiculously loud.

Every day, between 9am and 6pm. Even wearing noise cancelling headphones and with music on you can't get any rest.

They offered us the potential to move rooms, but on the day my partner was unwell and we were checking out the next day anyway. All our friends throughout the hotel had the same issue.

Not good enough for a 5 star hotel.

There's an ugly video door phone inside and very basic lighting controls which makes the whole place feel like a cheap budget hotel

Their Ginger hotels which are a budget hotel have some identity to their design. This is a mess.

che026,che026_r1,Bharat Jhunjhunwala,3,"Elegant Property, Excellent Staff — But Buffet Dinner Was a Total Letdown

Stayed at Park Hyatt Chennai and while much of the experience was pleasant, there were a few key disappointments.

The staff was superb — warm, welcoming, and highly professional.

Check-in and check-out were smooth and efficient.

Rooms are spacious and comfortable, but could definitely use better lighting, especially in the evenings.

Concierge and front desk took unusually long to respond to calls — phones kept ringing without an answer.

The biggest letdown: buffet dinner was shockingly poor for the price charged. The spread was very limited, especially for a luxury hotel. 0/5 for this — completely not worth the premium rate.

Additionally, they even charged for a 4-year-old child, which felt unreasonable.

Aside from the buffet disappointment, the property is well-maintained, and most services were on point. But for a hotel of this caliber, such a poor dinner spread was unexpected and dampened the experience.",2025-07-12T08:32:29.095237762Z,a month ago

Food in the restaurants is great especially flying elephant  - though the omelette i was ordering for myself for breakfast, was inconsistent across the 3 days I had. Room service order on one night was incorrect- got a veg pad Thai instead of a prawn one. And when I mentioned it, there wasn't any reaction or apology which was weird. I think it lacks these finer aspects of service. I felt the room had a strong room freshener smell and I was personally unable to sleep well ( felt either too hot or too warm in the room).

A special shout out to the Food and Beverage team their service was nothing short of outstanding. They were attentive, friendly & went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable dining experience.

We were lucky to catch the final day of a truly amazing food festival. The variety, flavors, and presentation of the dishes were simply outstanding! It’s unfortunate that it was the last day, because I would’ve loved to return for more.

The hotel features both a rooftop restaurant with a beautiful ambiance and a stylish ground floor restaurant, both serving delicious food & offering fantastic service. Whether you’re a guest at the hotel or just stopping by for a meal, I highly recommend dining at either location.

Kudos to the entire team at The Pride Hotel for creating such a wonderful atmosphere and delivering excellence at every level. We’ll definitely be back!",2025-08-25T04:59:45.018365803Z,a week ago

The venue was beautifully maintained, clean, and perfectly arranged. From the welcome drink and starters to the main course, every item on the menu was absolutely delicious—our guests were truly impressed. The bar counter setup was elegant and well-organized, adding a classy touch to the event.

A special mention to the F&B Manager Mr.Jyothi Sankar & team for serving everything with such warmth and a smile—their hospitality really stood out and created a wonderful atmosphere.

Heartfelt thanks to the F&B Manager and the Master Chef Mr.Ganesh & Mr.Sudeep for the excellent planning, execution, and flavors. Also, sincere appreciation to the Front Office Manager Mr.Alex and team for warmly receiving guests and guiding them smoothly to the event space.

Thanks as well to the Security team for efficiently managing the parking area, and to the Housekeeping manager Mr.Sridhar & team for keeping the venue spotless throughout.

Cleanliness & Maintenance: Initially, I was given a used room with unchanged bed linen. After requesting a change, a new room was provided, but the floor was still not cleaned properly.

There was barely enough space to move or keep luggage comfortably. The most disappointing part was the condition of the floors — they were sticky and felt unclean, which made it very uncomfortable to walk around, even with slippers.

Housekeeping was just average, but the cleaning felt rushed and not thorough. Basic cleanliness and hygiene should be a priority, especially in hospitality, but it was clearly lacking here.

The room also had a weird damp smell that didn’t go away, and the overall ambiance was dull. The photos online were quite misleading compared to what was actually offered. Even the bed linens didn’t feel fresh or properly washed.

che029,che029_r4,Dibyajyoti Kundu (Rudra),5,"We had the pleasure of staying at Grand One Tower – a true Business Class Hotel in Chennai – not just once, but three times last year, and every time felt like a home away from home.

Their 24×7 check-in and check-out facility is a huge advantage, especially for travellers with unpredictable schedules. But what made our experience truly memorable was the warmth, efficiency, and attentiveness of the entire team.

Special thanks to Mr. Zakariya at the reception – always professional, welcoming, kind and very helpful. And a big appreciation for Juel from housekeeping – always polite and ready to assist. He always promptly brought our online food orders to the room with a smile – truly commendable service.

We opted for a room with a kitchen, which made our stay even more convenient. The kitchen had almost all the basic utensils – even a Mortar and Pestle (Hamandista), which was a thoughtful addition. However, one thing that was missing was a Vessel Holder (Sarashi). Including that would make the kitchen setup even more complete.

In the room all basic amenities were well provided, and the daily housekeeping service kept everything clean and comfortable. We especially appreciated that anything we needed was just a phone call away – the reception team responded immediately.

We noticed that only on some floors had the refrigerator outside at one corner of the floor. So, we specifically chose our room based on the fridge placement and the staff kindly accommodated our preferences.

A small suggestion: the bathroom tiles in the shower area get a bit slippery when wet, although it’s limited to just that section and not the entire bathroom. It would be great if this could be addressed to enhance safety.
Also, the exhaust fan feels slightly underpowered for the bathroom size.

Even though this is a late review, the hospitality and comfort we experienced are still fresh in our minds. We’re already planning to stay at Grand One Tower again on our next visit to Chennai.

This hotel turned out to be a major disappointment. The nightly rate is even higher than that of the famous The Leela Palace, which naturally sets certain expectations. Unfortunately, the reality was far from what was promised.

Upon arrival, we immediately noticed that the room provided did not match the photos shown on the booking platform. For a price of over 30,000 rupees per night, this is simply unacceptable. The room was half the size advertised, and somehow ended up being twice as expensive. Despite having a confirmed reservation, no suitable alternative was offered.

The service was extremely poor: no valet, very slow response times, and untrained staff who were unable to explain the situation clearly. As a result, we were left without a place to stay late at night, with a child, forced to search for another hotel on our own.

It’s truly unfortunate that a hotel charging such high rates fails to meet even the basic standards of service. We do not recommend staying here if you value comfort, transparency, and respectful treatment.",2025-07-03T15:45:09.781332484Z,2 months ago

I can't really comment on  the location. We will get Uber autos to go anywhere, so I'll bump up the rating by 2 ( only if you can ignore the loud noise /music played by locals right at the back of the hotel)

Rooms
Condition:- Pathetic,
Hygiene:' If there's a negative rating, I would give that.
Cleanliness:- No one knows there's space below bed, below table etc  so all the dust from decades can be seen and FELT in the room.
Bathroom :- Has an odor of its own, natural. Now I'll leave the rest for your imagination.
Bed :- Bedsheets have been changed, but all stains can be seen.
We are quite sure it will have bedbugs too, if they can survive in Chennai heat.
Tv :- Only Tamil channels (no complaints here, but it's a point worth noting)
Cupboards :- Automatic opening facility is there. It will automatically open, and you will find it hard to close.

And the best thing I liked was cockroaches.
Yes, we saw them crawling on the walls inside the room.
I mean, it will be a miracle if we don't see cockroaches in such ""well"" maintained rooms.

I stayed at Kaira Park just yesterday with my aunt and her daughter, in between transit and I genuinely felt the need to share how pleasantly surprised we were with the entire experience.

First of all, the location is fantastic—surrounded by cozy cafes that stay open till late, which was a real treat for us. The area feels alive even at night, and both Uber and Ola were easily available at any time, which made commuting super convenient.

The hospitality stood out the most. As two women traveling with a teen girl, safety and comfort were top priorities for us—and the staff here made sure we felt both. They were kind, respectful, and went out of their way to make our stay easy. Not only did they let us leave our luggage at the reception after checkout, but they also upgraded our room without us even asking. That kind of thoughtful gesture is rare and really speaks to the kind of people they are—genuinely good with the right attitude.

The room itself was lovely—super neat and well-equipped with all modern amenities. It gave the vibe of a newly renovated space—everything looked and felt fresh and clean, which made settling in so easy.

che035,che035_r2,William Vijai Paul K,4,"We recently stayed at this hotel in Chennai, and our overall experience was quite pleasant with a few highs and lows. The room was simply superb — we originally booked a Superior Room but were pleasantly surprised when the hotel upgraded us to a Junior Suite at no extra cost. This gesture definitely elevated our stay and gave us a great room experience.

The hotel staff were trendy and professional, but unfortunately, we didn’t feel properly welcomed on arrival. The front desk seemed too caught up in their work to give us the warm hospitality you’d expect from a 5-star property.

Despite being located in a busy part of Chennai, stepping into the hotel felt like entering a completely different atmosphere — calm, elegant, and peaceful.

We had opted for both breakfast and dinner buffet. The breakfast buffet was quite good, offering a decent spread. However, the dinner buffet was disappointing — the taste and variety did not live up to a 5-star standard and definitely needs improvement.

A special mention goes to the swimming pool — it was fantastic, very relaxing, and had thoughtful features that made it a highlight of our stay.

To sum it up: the room and overall hotel services were excellent, especially the complimentary upgrade and pool experience. The welcome experience and food quality, particularly dinner, were the downsides. With better attention to hospitality and culinary refinement, this hotel could truly deliver a top-tier experience.",2025-06-15T17:44:09.763492Z,2 months ago
che035,che035_r3,Subash Rajaram,1,"I felt much of  the privacy concern in their rooms. Did not expect this from the ITC group of hotels. There was a Locked Door in the partition wall between the two rooms. Through that door Voice was clearly audible from the other room. Rooms are not sound proof. As the Hotel is near the Main road, it was so noisy in the night which was disturbing while sleeping. Not good to have any business meetings from the room.

Definitely not worth for the Cost.

Room were neat and spacious enough. There was no Compromise in Cleanliness.",2025-08-29T05:02:32.982049129Z,a week ago

che036,che036_r1,Vishnu,2,"Not the best hotel experience I have had.

The plus are the location of this hotel. It is in T Nagar which is centre to everywhere. Moreover for the cost, this was one of the best options. However, the negative is that the rooms are not that good. The rooms are not silent proof. It was very worse. I was able to hear the next rooms TV sound until 11.45 pm. They had their tv on full blast for some reason. And once it was over, there were people walking in the hallway throughout the entire night. The rooms seriously need some sound proofing.

Other than that, nothing was special about this place. The breakfast was mediocre. Could have gone for better options for the price outside the hotel.",2025-08-27T13:23:39.947737300Z,a week ago

che036,che036_r3,Aveena Raj,1,"I had a terrible experience at this hotel. The room was filthy, and worst of all, the bed was infested with bed bugs. My companions and I were bitten multiple times, leaving us with itchy and painful marks. We barely got any sleep because of the discomfort.

The toilet was disgusting, there was black mold on the door and at the bottom of the toilet, making it clear that cleanliness is not a priority at this hotel. It was unhygienic and completely unacceptable.

When we reported the bed bug issue to the hotel staff, despite showing clear evidence of the bites, they completely denied that the bed had bed bugs. Instead of properly addressing the issue, their “solution” was to swap the bed with another from a different room, which is beyond unacceptable!

To make things worse, the manager and receptionist were extremely rude and unhelpful, showing no concern for our situation. The manager dismissed our complaint, saying that in his many years there, they had never experienced bed bugs, yet my entire family was covered in bites! The only saving grace was a kind and understanding female staff, but unfortunately, that did not make up for the horrible experience we had.

Avoid this hotel at all costs unless you want to deal with poor hygiene, bed bugs, dirty toilets, and rude staff.",2025-04-02T01:50:10.486320Z,5 months ago

While the housekeeping service was consistent initially, it became slower during the last three days—I had to follow up a couple of times to get my room cleaned. They said the laundry person sent the items late. They did clean my room with a friendly smile.  😃  Thanks to Ms Usha.

I made my booking through Agoda. Although my initial room request wasn’t fulfilled on the first day, I was moved to a room with a bigger bed on the second day. It didn’t have a window view, but it was clean, cozy, and comfortable.

The location is excellent—easily accessible autos, walking distance to Pondy Bazaar and the Om Namo Narayana temple, several good vegetarian restaurants, and even a handy sundry shop nearby.

I had an early morning flight, and the hotel reception kindly arranged a cab for me. He went the extra mile by negotiating the fare with the driver to ensure I got a reasonable and fair price for the ride. As the bell boy was not free, the restaurant waiter help me with my baggages.

The front desk team, especially Adam and Aditya, were quick to respond and made sure everything went smoothly during my stay. Their service really stood out.

Room service was good, and the food I ordered came on time and tasted nice. The room itself was quiet, which helped me rest well, and the hotel’s location near the metro station made it easy to get around the city.

However, I felt that the room quality and the amenities didn’t match the price I paid. For the cost, I expected better features and a more comfortable setup. The room had the basic things, but it didn’t feel special or worth the high price. Small touches like better toiletries, improved decor, or extra facilities would have made a big difference.

In short, the hotel is in a good location with polite and responsive staff, but it could improve on room quality and amenities to make the stay feel more valuable for the money spent.",2025-07-10T05:37:03.635846911Z,a month ago

Toiletries provided included towel and soap. Dental kit, shaving kit, etc would be provided upon request. They don't provide complementary bottled water but I think they have water purifier available.

- Good beds
-  Airconditioning
- Private shower
- Clean room
- Close to the beach
- Central location

Cons:
- Room looked dated compared to the picture
- Can be very noisy when people walk and talk around

che045,che045_r3,vasishta veeramasuneni,1,"I stayed in Green Park hotel in Chennai on July 17th and was assigned a room where I encountered a serious hygiene issue: cockroaches. Despite informing the front desk immediately, the response was minimal. Only one dead cockroach was removed and I was told everything was fine—but sightings continued throughout the day. I’ve documented this with photographs.
I emailed the hotel and attached the photos, expecting a timely response. Unfortunately, I received no reply or acknowledgment. This lack of follow-up only added to the frustration.

As a returning guest, I had expected much better. The casual response to a cleanliness concern was unacceptable, especially after spending a significant amount at the hotel’s in-house restaurant. This experience has deeply affected my trust in the property.

I hope the management takes feedback like this seriously and works to improve both hygiene standards and responsiveness.",2025-07-29T05:25:04.461097667Z,a month ago

One highlight that truly stood out was the live flute player in the mornings—his music was absolutely beautiful. We made it a point to sit and watch him play every day. It gave us such a happy, peaceful start and really boosted our mood each morning.

The location is also a major plus. There’s a mall right beside the hotel, which made things super convenient, and there are temples and local shops all around, all within walking distance. It was very easy to get around without needing transport all the time.

One thing I do wish they considered, though, is showcasing more of the Indian culture. Many people visit places like this to experience that unique cultural touch, but none of the staff or servers reflected it. It would have been lovely to see them in traditional Indian attire—it would have added so much charm and authenticity, instead of sticking solely to Western norms.",2025-04-19T04:35:45.019649Z,4 months ago

I came to visit chennai with my one year old child and asked an umbrella then they replied very rudely. So I never recommend to any family to visit this place and after paying money you will suffer. We booked for 3 but no extra bed was provided. We had to squeeze in a bed for 2 and mattress was too old so it was very difficult to sleep as it was queen size bed.

Service levels can be improved as they have only 1-2 folks as room boys for the entire hotel and morning breakfast should start at least by 7 am vs the 8-8:30 am currently.

Room cleaning doens't happen in my 3 day stay, it's possible that I wasn't in room that time but I was available a whole day and they didn't bother.

Didn't even provided something to wipe your feet so room infront of bathroom. TV didn't work either for some reason. It wasn't faulty, just didn't opened. And the worst thing, wifi is complete shit of this hotel and you don't get much of phone network in room so you are stuck with shitty WiFi. Room was fine although I felt like sheets werent new but I could be wrong.

I was told that I can check in at 10am but I still had to wait for 2 hours but it can just be a issue which happened that day. No extra charges or anything. AC worked fine and so did elevators. There's a restaurant near it so good wasn't an issue either. Wouldn't go there again on purpose though since bathroom was just too damn bad.

Also the water for some reason came really slow and it completely stopped once I was in bathroom. I mean...it comes down to bathroom again and again.

che047,che047_r4,Lucy Mills,1,"Me and my partner booked this hotel through the OYO helpline because many affordable hotels don't accept foreigners. On advice and consultation from the helpline she assured us that the booking accepts foreigners. I needed to do some visa work which required my C form and this hotel did not make and refused to make the document which is necessary and by law required. They were video calling friends with me in the background which violated my sense of self.

The actual rooms were super ill equipped. The ac did not work (in fact many people complained about this), the bedsheets were super stained!! Gross. They did not provide towls in the room and the water for the shower wasn't working at first. We switched rooms where the ac and the water was working but the bedsheets were still stained. The staff were like zombies, you asked them to help they just stare blankly at you or are actually actively trying to be more unhelpful and just want you to get out the way.

In the end we demanded a full refund, this they gave  - great. It was definitely cheaper than a complaint for not doing their legal duty of a c form. awful experience",2025-04-01T10:56:26.221309Z,5 months ago

What stood out was the buffet spread — a good variety of dishes across cuisines, and everything we tried tasted great. It’s definitely one of the highlights if you enjoy hotel dining.

The location is another big plus. Situated on the OMR and near Taramani, it’s ideal if you have meetings or work around this part of Chennai. The views from the room were lovely too, adding a touch of calm to the business vibe.

che048,che048_r5,Biju Brahma,1,"We chose this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary, hoping for a special and memorable experience. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bit disappointing. Upon arrival, we saw the room was far too small and the bed was nowhere near what one would expect for a superior queen size bed. While we appreciated that the staff did arrange some decorations adviced by wife however the overall size and condition of the room felt misleading and underwhelming.

We booked ""Superior Queen Room"" for three days. Room felt congested and claustrophobic. AC was too slow we were sweating. The bathroom smell like someone smoked for really long time. Even after room freshener it didn't went. After celebrating our disappointing anniversary in the room. We found difficult to sleep on the small bed.

Eventually we had to upgrade the room on the second day, but even that didn’t improve much. The air conditioning was working way too slow, and cleanliness was clearly not a priority. There were few stains on the sofa, bathroom was not cleaned properly. Bed was king but the sheet was for Queen. It was not tucking properly. Had to call room service to fix the bed everytime.

The food was average, serving similar food almost everyday. One morning I took few fruits but it was rotten it had smell. Although they changed immediately but it was there job to check the quality. The most shocking moment came on our last day when my wife saw a cockroach on a buffet plate – I had to personally inform a staff member to remove it. This could have cost life if the cockroaches are on the buffet plate.

Although a few staff members were polite and tried their best, the overall experience was unacceptable. What should have been a joyful anniversary celebration ended up disappointing. For the amount what my wife paid for the suprise especially for the decoration and room upgrade, the service and quality were nowhere close to the expectations.

When we finally got to our room, it was filthy—stained sheets, hair in the shower, and a terrible smell of dampness.

To make matters worse, the air conditioning was broken, and despite multiple complaints, no one bothered to fix it. The walls were paper-thin, and we could hear everything from the neighboring rooms, making sleep impossible.

Breakfast was a joke—stale bread, cold coffee, and barely edible food. The worst part? The staff was rude and dismissive, acting like they were doing us a favor by even acknowledging our complaints.

I have stayed in budget hotels before, but this was beyond unacceptable. If you value cleanliness, comfort, and basic hospitality, stay far away from this place.

The room was filthy—unclean sheets, dust everywhere, and a bathroom that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks.

che053,che053_r4,Ronald Christopher Simon,1,"Worst Experience Ever! Please read completely before going!

I visited Citrus Café at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram with my fiancée, expecting at least basic professionalism for the money they charge. Instead, it turned out to be the worst dining experience I’ve ever had. A complete waste of time and patience.

I ordered a Greek salad, clearly written in the menu with feta cheese. What arrived after one hour was a bowl of chunky, oversized vegetable pieces drowned in lemon juice, with paneer thrown on top instead of feta. No oregano, no olive oil , basically, it wasn’t a Greek salad at all. The staff never bothered to tell us they didn’t have feta. I had to ask the waitress why there was paneer, only for her to casually say, “We don’t have feta, sir.” No apology, no heads-up, nothing.

The basics are missing here. I asked for grilled peri peri chicken skewers with minimal oil and made it extremely clear that my medical condition doesn’t permit me to eat oily food. What came out of the kitchen was deep fried, not grilled. So their “grilled” skewers are a lie too. The staff just shrugged and said sorry. When I asked for the manager, nobody showed up. The kitchen staff came instead and claimed the manager was “busy”.

I also ordered two lime sodas. They never arrived. After wasting an entire hour waiting for just a salad and a wrongly cooked chicken, I told them I’d pay for the pathetic salad and leave. They refused to even let me pay, acting guilty, but what’s the point? Basic courtesy and competence are missing here.

This place claims to have a decent a la carte menu. The reality is they don’t have half the ingredients, they don’t tell you upfront, and they have zero training to handle basic customer requests.

If you value your time, money, tastebuds, and basic respect, do not step inside Citrus Café at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram. It’s run by incompetent staff, clueless chefs, and a manager who hides when there’s a problem. For a brand like Lemon Tree, this level of service is embarrassing.

Never going back. Strongly NOT recommended.",2025-07-04T18:29:02.254978009Z,2 months ago

We booked a one-night business stay for two people with the expectation of a comfortable and professional environment. Unfortunately, our experience at this hotel fell far short of even the most basic standards.

The room itself was in unacceptable condition. Upon entry, we were overwhelmed by a strong, unpleasant odor that made it difficult to relax. The hygiene standards were clearly not up to mark, and the state of the room made it unsuitable for a restful night.

Most concerning was the bedbug infestation we discovered. Throughout the night, we experienced severe discomfort, and the presence of bedbugs made it nearly impossible to sleep. This is not just an inconvenience—it's a serious health and cleanliness issue that should never be overlooked in any accommodation, let alone one catering to business travelers.

che071,che071_r5,Rajashree Biswal,1,"I recently stayed at Taj Wellington Mews in Chennai, and unfortunately, my experience was far below the expectations typically associated with the Taj brand.

From the moment of arrival, the service was underwhelming. Despite booking in advance, there was no greeting or assistance from the security or staff at the gates. I had to step out, open my car trunk, and hand over the luggage myself—something I've never had to do at any other Taj property. There was no welcome drink or gesture at the check-in counter either, which is usually a hallmark of Taj hospitality.

Upon reaching my room, I noticed the cookie jar—which has always been a small but appreciated touch in other Taj hotels—was missing. I then headed to the pool, only to find it disappointingly small in both length and width.

The breakfast experience the next morning continued the trend. The spread was quite limited compared to other Taj properties, and the counters were small and crowded. The restaurant staff seemed rushed and inattentive. Simple requests for items like Yakult, cashews, or juices were repeatedly forgotten, and I had to follow up multiple times. There was little sense of warmth or attentiveness from the staff, and it felt like they were just going through the motions.

Even during checkout, there was no enquiry about my stay or if I had any feedback. I was simply handed a small elephant souvenir. While a kind gesture in itself, it did little to make up for the service lapses. The departure process was frustrating—staff handled the luggage roughly and even opened the rear seats of my car without asking. They were trying to force all the bags into the trunk instead of checking with me first. I had to intervene, reattach the seats, and instruct them on how to arrange the luggage.

Overall, this stay was a letdown, especially considering my consistently positive experiences with other Taj hotels. The lack of warmth, coordination, and attention to detail was very surprising and disappointing.",2025-05-01T16:51:56.810596Z,4 months ago

che073,che073_r3,lethika rajp,3,"1.	Reception & Staff:
•	The reception team and hotel staff were extremely polite, professional, and courteous throughout our stay.
•	Their behavior and hospitality are highly appreciated.
2.	Stay Duration:
•	We stayed for one week as part of our official duty pattern, visiting frequently for work purposes.

3.	Room Condition (First & Second Floor):
•	Rooms provided on the first and second floors are in poor condition and urgently need renovation.
•	Carpets are old, stained, and have a strong smell.
•	Washrooms are leaking, and the flush systems are not working properly.
•	Showers are faulty and tend to fall off while in use.
•	Mirrors in the room are stained and unclear.
•	Visible dust accumulation in the nooks and corners of the rooms.
•	Overall, the room interiors are outdated and not suitable for a comfortable stay.

4.	Cleanliness & Maintenance:
•	The general condition suggests that renovation might be ongoing, but unfortunately, the rooms currently in use are not guest-ready.

5.	Food & Restaurant:
•	The food quality at the restaurant is good, and the overall dining experience is satisfactory.

6.	Travel Desk & Cab Service:
•	The travel desk staff are humble and supportive, but some cabs provided for airport transfers need better maintenance.

•	A few vehicles had poor air conditioning and unmaintained interiors.

•	Though not all cabs were in bad condition, there is no way for guests to know in advance which cab they will receive.

•	In urgent situations—especially airport pickups and drops—receiving a cab in such condition is inconvenient and needs immediate improvement.

*	7.	Overall Suggestion:

•	If renovation is in progress or rooms are not in good condition, it is a humble request not to accept guests in such rooms.

•	As business travelers, proper rest and comfort are essential, and the current room conditions made it difficult to rest well.

•	Accepting guests into non-maintained rooms affects their experience and performance, especially those staying for official duties.

*Final Note:
The staff is doing their best, but the infrastructure—both room and travel services—needs urgent attention. Once the renovation and service updates are done, the hotel will be able to deliver a much better and reliable experience for its guests.",2025-07-01T05:26:57.482263681Z,2 months ago

che074,che074_r2,Pratik Vaidya,2,"I stayed at Marriott Chennai for 5 nights (July 13–18) with my wife and child during our US visa appointments. We chose Marriott for a safe and hygienic stay, fully dependent on the hotel for all meals.

Unfortunately, both I and my son fell ill on separate days after eating at the buffet — I had stomach pain after a salad, and my son suffered vomiting and loose motions. The hotel management assured me that food samples had been sent for lab testing, but without any transparency or follow-up, I’m unsure how effective that really is. I was also given the usual standard assurances about Marriott following “the highest food safety protocols,” but our experience says otherwise.

I also noticed the hotel seemed understaffed, with ground-level staff working long hours. Being close to the US Consulate, I feel the hotel has become complacent, relying on constant short-stay guests.

I’m writing this review not just to share my personal experience, but to ensure there’s a public record. If others face similar issues, there will be a trail of repeated incidents for reference. I sincerely hope Marriott’s senior management or global leadership looks into such cases and takes serious corrective action.

Spending over ₹1 lakh for a five-day stay — only to fall ill and spend most of my time managing my and my son’s health — is not acceptable. Food safety and hygiene cannot be compromised, especially at a hotel of this reputation and price point.",2025-07-20T06:20:30.167524773Z,a month ago

One of the highlights is the gym—it's large, well-maintained, and fully equipped with everything you’d need for a solid workout. While it’s a bit disappointing that there’s no swimming pool, the hotel does offer good spa services to help you unwind.

che074,che074_r5,Taha Adib,2,"I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. I was deeply disappointed. I am surprised that Marriott allows his hotel to be called four stars. The facility, especially the lobby and restaurant area is extremely old and not well maintained it. The service in the restaurant for breakfast is horrible. Extremely slow, tables are dirty, the best way to get anything is to literally walk up to somebody. During my say where a number of issues. At one point, the water was coming out of the faucet in the shower was brown. And dirty. The room itself was fine. Nothing to worry about, but decent and clean. Housekeeping is good. The executive lounge is bare minimum. The polish at this hotel just does not exist. Hallways and elevator are often dirty. Benches outside the elevator are covered in dust. Sometimes I have called the front desk and I am on hold for 15 minutes. The only reason I’m not giving it this hotel a one star, is because Tamana who works there was exceptional and did her best to rectify and enhance the experience. She’s a rockstar. She needs to be kept and valued to turn around this hotel. In the meantime, I would consider this a 2 or 3 star hotel. Not a 4.",2025-07-13T22:53:46.560190647Z,a month ago

3. The room walls are like paper, you can hear a quiet conversation in the other room, you should hope your neighbours are decent. You can also hear the doors closing and opening everywhere.
4. The hotel is very far from the center of the city, peak hours can make it worse.

For a hotel under the Marriott brand, this level of construction flaw is unacceptable.

I requested a room upgrade, even offered to pay for a suite, but the team showed no willingness to help or even acknowledge the inconvenience caused. Disappointing hospitality and no resolution throughout the stay.

A major disappointment was their visitor policy. My close relative, who had dropped us from the airport and was helping with important work discussions, was not allowed in the room — something never mentioned on the website. After he complained about their poor service, reception deliberately referred to him as a “driver,” which felt insulting and unprofessional.

The unprofessionalism extended to the restaurant. My cousin overheard a staff member rudely mocking a guest who had ordered in-room breakfast, making inappropriate comments.

The only positive was the location. Cleanliness was average, service was practically non-existent, and staff behavior was unprofessional and at times disrespectful.

che078,che078_r1,Budmil Budapest,4,"I would gladly award this hotel 5 stars if the food was good but unfortunately the dinner buffet, though it is relatively cheap for hotel residents, was not good.

As food is problematic in the sipcot area I have no choice but reduce one star from the total rating.

The service throughout the property is fantastic.

All members of staff are attentive and go the extra mile to accommodate guest's needs.

I wish to mention Mr. Akhil who I believe is the head receptionist or duty manager and his colleague (he sat at the priority desk at reception) who I forgot his name but was equally courteous and helpful.

There are always members of staff at the lobby who greet guests and offer two types of free drinks (detox water and a sweeter drink that varies from day to day).

Mr. Antoine is always smiling and eager to help.

He speaks Tamil and he patiently assisted me by calling uber drivers as many of them need prompting over the phone before they come (probably because my method of payment was cash).

I used the hotel's transport service twice and was extremely satisfied on both occasions.

The driver on my first trip (around 40 kilometers inland) is called Rajiv Gandhi which is why I remember his name.

The driver on my second drive (to the airport) was also superb but I can not remember his name.

The main problem at the restaurant is there is only one AC unit (placed roughly in the middle of the dining hall).

Not only does it make the dining hall uncomfortably warm it also means the area where the food is cooked is not cool enough for a 5 star hotel.

This problem can be easily remedied by adding an ac unit and having it face the direction of the open kitchen (with the current arrangement the dining hall reminds me of a food court in South Delhi).

The food is aimed mainly at North Indian tastes (probably because many guests are temporary workers and visitors at IT companies and hail from other parts of India) but it lacks authenticity and the desserts are inedible.

In summary I enjoyed staying here much more than my two recent stays at the Novotel OMR but the dinner buffet at the Novotel OMR was markedly tastier.",2025-07-13T10:45:41.855376412Z,a month ago

The front desk employees are unaware of the reservations made by the guests. I arrived at around 13:30 and was asked to wait in the reception area even though I had paid for a reservation that began at 10:00 am. One of the staff members assisted me get a room after I showed him my reservation.

The receptionists were ineffective, they clustered together and pretended to be busy when there were no customers at the desk.  The reception lobby was packed with students from the nearby college like in a dorm.

The smell of mold was filling the rooms. The central Air conditioner operated erratically and failed to maintain the room temperature. The bathroom was tiny, outdated, and full of broken fixtures.

This means either the data was leaked or hacked. When I called the hotel, they acknowledged being aware of such scams and said their team was working on it. If they knew about this, they should have at least notified guests in advance to ignore such messages, which they failed to do.

Coming to the stay, the first room we were given had a terrible odor, and we had to request a room change. The second room was better, but even there, the bathroom light was fused. By then, we were so disappointed that we didn’t bother asking for another change.

Restaurant staff behaviour was an epitome of unprofessionalism The food was served cold, as though it had just been taken out of the refrigerator. It was clear that it hadn't been properly heated before being plated. I expected a warm, freshly made meal, but instead, I got something that felt like it had been sitting around for far too long. Which when mentioned to the staff they agreed to it without showing any regret.

Key card was not functioning at times, making it difficult to access my room. I had to go back to the front desk each time to get a new card or have it reprogrammed, which became time-consuming and inconvenient. Although the receptionist attended to the issue,  the card was not reprogrammed properly, have to visit reception for the second time due to this issue.

The staff was polite and spoke good English. I paid around ₹3,800 per night and found it worth the price.

The entire place reeks of smoke and rot — every single room feels filthy. The first room they gave me had a broken TV and the AC didn’t work. They only sent someone to fix it around 10 PM. The next morning, when I was rushing to get ready for an appointment, the shower knob broke. I had just 30 minutes before I had to leave, yet no one came for 15 minutes despite repeated calls. After half an hour they finally moved me to another room. No apology, no courtesy check, nothing.

When I mentioned this to the front desk lady, she completely dismissed me and said it wasn’t her job, pointing me to someone else. Absolutely zero customer service.

The breakfast buffet at Oasis was impressive, with a mix of Indian and continental options, though a bit more variety in North Indian dishes would be great.

The only drawbacks were minor maintenance issues in the bathroom, like a slow-draining sink, and the parking experience could be improved, as I had trouble getting assistance with luggage. The pool and fitness center were well-maintained, adding to the overall comfort. Great value for money and ideal for business travelers or those exploring Chennai.

che092,che092_r1,Lakshman Raghu,1,"Zero-Star Experience – Misleading Promises and Costly Damage

I am writing this review out of sheer frustration and disappointment with my recent stay at Grand Residence. What was supposed to be a simple, hassle-free experience turned into an absolute nightmare due to gross negligence and misleading assurances.

Despite booking this hotel specifically because of the promised parking availability, I was shocked to find there were no usable parking slots on-site. Instead, I was instructed to leave my car outside the hotel premises — an area completely infested with pigeon droppings. It's clear this is a long-standing issue that the management has willfully ignored.

As a direct result of this, my vehicle suffered severe paint damage, with the outer layer peeling off due to the acidic contamination. The repair costs are estimated at INR 20,000, which is almost seven times what I paid for my stay. This is completely unacceptable and reflects a total disregard for guest property and satisfaction.

To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. This experience was not just inconvenient — it was financially damaging and deeply frustrating. I would strongly advise others to think twice before trusting the claims made by this establishment.

Avoid at all costs unless you're ready to pay a heavy price — quite literally — for your stay.",2025-07-28T09:25:00.301487894Z,a month ago

che093,che093_r3,Indira Olivier,1,"Terrible experience – absolutely not worth four stars!

We stayed here for one night – and that was already one too many. Upon arrival, our driver was spoken to in a very rude manner and was not allowed to park the car at the hotel. There are also no facilities for drivers to stay overnight, which is something many travelers in India would reasonably expect.

The rooms were clean – and that’s the only positive point we can mention. The rest of the stay was extremely disappointing. Major construction work is currently going on, causing a lot of noise, dust, and an overall unpleasant atmosphere. This was never communicated to us beforehand – very dishonest towards guests.

Breakfast was a disgrace for a hotel that claims to be four-star quality. The so-called ""continental"" options were limited to some toast, butter, and fruit. The Indian breakfast had more variety, but most items smelled sour and seemed far from fresh. In the bar, we even saw cockroaches. The central air conditioning made such loud noise that sleeping was very difficult.

To make things worse, we were charged an additional 1800 INR for a simple camp bed for our driver – someone whose good night's rest is crucial for our safety.

We understand that renovations may be necessary, but communicate this clearly and temporarily close your doors if you cannot guarantee basic comfort. Right now, you are delivering an experience unworthy of the term ""hotel.""

Food:
We ordered lunch and dinner from the hotel and, honestly, it was below average. I’d recommend avoiding meals here altogether.
The breakfast buffet was decent, though probably the only saving grace foodwise.

Safety Concern :
This is something I really want to highlight.
Around 1AM, someone rang the bell claiming to be from the restaurant and asked if we had requested food to be reheated. I clearly hadn’t made any such request. He double-checked the room number and left, but the whole thing felt very fishy and unsettling.

I reported this to the reception. They said they would look into it,

One major problem with this hotel is the parking. If you are not diligent about collecting the parking coupon and handing it at the mall parking exit, money will be automatically debited from your Fastag and the hotel takes no responsibility for it. We were unaware of this the first time, nor did the hotel inform us. So more than ₹800 got deducted from our Fastag and the hotel refused to provide any sort of compensation. Too disappointing.
Another thing to be mindful of is your ID proofs after check-in. The staff tends to forget to return them, and we noticed they had a huge stack of unclaimed IDs. So, be sure to collect yours before heading to your room.
Coming to the good part, the breakfast at Annam Cafe is great. Rooms have all the amenities. The hotel is designed in a unique and interesting fashion - truly a “Design Hotel”, lol.

I liked the design here but it lacks function in many places and as the forgotten saying in architecture - form follows function. The standard room has a highly inaccessible area for the A/C controller and the tea/ coffee, milk sachets. The rooms could have been a little bit more tidier, the air conditioners had dust in them.  The third floor is where the cafe is and due to lack of ventilation in the passageway, there was a strong stench from the kitchen in the passageway (I dont think this is a cause of concern and it is just particular to my stay)
The reason I am giving 3.5/5 stars is because of the location with direct lift to the mall through Purple Chameleon restaurant, the discount you can get at this restaurant if you stay at the hotel and the courteous staff who prepared us breakfast before 7 AM (breakfast buffet starts at 7:30 AM ).

What made it stand out for me was the way we were cared for, especially when it came to food. My parents are elderly and have multiple dietary restrictions, which often makes travelling and dining out a bit challenging for us as a family. We were unsure of how things would be managed, but what happened next genuinely moved us.

Mr. Kartick, who looked after us during our stay, was nothing short of a blessing. From the very beginning, he noticed the specific needs of my parents and took it upon himself to ensure they were comfortable and well taken care of. He didn’t just do his duty—he went above and beyond, often checking in personally, remembering their preferences, and serving food that was not only suitable for their health but also brought them a sense of home and comfort.

It felt like he wasn’t just serving guests—he was serving with care, empathy, and a big heart. Watching my parents enjoy their meals without worry, feeling relaxed and nurtured, meant the world to me. It’s not something we experience often, and I’ll always carry that with me.

On the day of event,in the last minute I have changed the person count which she supported with a happy face.

The reception staff(a male who attended the call and a female who was prompting from behind) were very very rude while responding . We are not staying free of cost but we are paying and staying. This is not the way to respond to a customer. We opted this hotel because of the location but now we are planning not to stay here . This is not the right way to talk to a customer . The management shouldn’t hire these kind of people or should teach them to speak politely. Worst response and this is not the way to treat a customer.,2024-03-06T12:02:18.573347Z,a year ago

che101,che101_r3,Ameer Vivek,4,"I wanted to take a moment to appreciate the wonderful experiences I’ve had at Halez. I always commend the spacious rooms, excellent amenities, and the hospitality of your staff. However, I’d like to bring to your attention a recurring concern regarding air conditioning.

On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed that the AC in the rooms is not cooling efficiently. While the team has been responsive in offering room changes, I believe a long-term solution would enhance the overall guest experience. Additionally, I’ve also felt that the cooling in the lobby could be improved to make it more comfortable. While sales and targets are crucial, guest experience plays an equally important role in long-term success.

Regarding the reception staff, I’ve seen some reviews about a particular female staff member being perceived as rude. However, from my personal experience, she has always been professional and efficient during my check-ins and check-outs. I do feel that if she isn’t smiling at times, it may simply mean something is off that day, rather than a reflection of her attitude. If she happens to read this, I just want to say she’s doing a great job, and I’d love to see a smile on her face!

Thank you for taking the time to consider this feedback. I truly appreciate the effort your team puts in and look forward to an even better stay next time.",2025-03-15T08:29:39.189358Z,5 months ago

One of the highlights is their bar, Satori, where the experience goes beyond just drinks. With every beer order, they serve a generous complimentary platter of potato chips, mixture, peanuts, and a unique soybean-onion-lemon starter — a thoughtful and delightful touch that truly sets them apart.

There is no proper reception, and the images shown on the website are heavily filtered — the reality is completely different. The property is a complete fraud. Once they take your money, they refuse to return it if you are not satisfied.

When I arrived, I couldn’t even stay for 5 minutes because of how unsafe and dirty the place was. The rooms aren’t even worth ₹500.

che111,che111_r3,Shinie,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I absolutely would. This is hands down the worst hotel I’ve ever experienced in all my travels.

First of all, the location is horrible—situated on one of the smelliest roads in Chennai, and that stench carries throughout the entire hotel. The moment you step in, you’re hit with an unbearable odor.

The room was a nightmare: stale, musty smell, dirty linen, torn wallpaper, and an unclean toilet. To make it worse, staff members seem to be using guest room toilets themselves, which is beyond unprofessional and unhygienic.

The service was just as disappointing. Most of the staff were North Indian and completely unhelpful. We paid ₹3000 upon check-in, entered the room, stayed barely 10 minutes, and immediately asked for a refund due to the filth. They refused and only after creating a scene did they finally return our money.

I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone—not even for a short stay. Avoid at all costs.",2025-04-15T08:11:19.086593Z,4 months ago

che112,che112_r1,Priyanka Gupta,3,"Location is near railway station so good in a way. The day we checked in we had requested for a higher floor room but they put us on the ground floor with a promise they will shift us. This room was cleaned in a hurry so okayish and like all rooms close to reception, it was noisy. We had to follow up with them all day as they kept saying no room free 24 hr checkout and so on and eventually we shifted at 10 pm at night which was not so convenient. The old man at the reception was rude. Construction going in side building so that side rooms will feel stones and building material constantly falling on their windows.

Higher floor room was nice. The windows of this hotel aren't much useful as blocked by buildings on all sides. Mostly cleaning was good except last day when we have keys and left and cleaning was not done. Then someone not from the housekeeping staff came and cleaned. This was frustrating and wasted time. Mistakes happen though.

They didn't want us to book online but didn't want to give the online price either. The guy at the reception spoke a lot repeatedly and kept saying 1700 we give for one person. That day room price was 1600 online. Eventually he said tomorrow if the online price is 2400 you pay that if today online price. To which we agreed.

The weirdest part was that while leaving they started giving us 200 rupees to not mention anything in the review. That was so bad.

che112,che112_r5,The Life Of Deafblind,2,"There are no complaints about the staff or service, but the rooms and bathrooms need to be maintained better.

Specifically, they are masking odors with strong fragrances in the bathrooms instead of actually cleaning the floors and toilet bowls. The toilet bowls are stained yellow, and there is no ventilation. They must install exhaust fans in the bathroom windows to eliminate unwanted smells. Room service was good, but the room boys communication was poor.

I paid ₹2190 through (MMT) for a standard double bed, but you can get the same room for ₹2000 if you book directly. While the price difference isn't significant, I don't understand why they encourage offline bookings over online ones, as the rates are essentially the same.

You can book this hotel if you have business in Periyamet or the area surrounding the Central Railway Station without any doubt. Other hotels in this area have issues with the smell of urine on their exterior walls and poor service.

I had a very unpleasant experience at this hotel due to the unprofessional and rude behavior of the receptionist. From the moment I arrived, the staff was unwelcoming and behaved very arrogantly.

To make matters worse, they demanded extra money without any clear explanation or justification, which is completely unacceptable and feels like a scam. When I questioned the additional charges, they responded rudely and refused to cooperate.

This kind of treatment is not what any guest expects when booking a hotel. I strongly advise others to be cautious before choosing this hotel. Hospitality and honesty are key in the service industry — and this hotel lacks both.not recommend",2025-07-06T18:18:03.447560782Z,2 months ago

che116,che116_r4,Parna Dhar,1,"Last week, I stayed here for a day. Everything about this place—the rooms, environment, and hospitality—was terrible. We had taken two rooms, one of which had a torn and stained bedsheet. They said they would change the bedsheet later, but even after my friend arrived, the bedsheet was not changed. Cockroaches were crawling all over the place, and the bathroom was as dirty as a public restroom at a railway station, with black spots all over the cistern and commode, and dead cockroaches lying around. Even though there was garbage outside the residency, I thought the interior might be nice, but I was disappointed as soon as I got into the lift. The lift is so small that if someone has 3-4 pieces of luggage, there wouldn't even be space to keep them overhead, and when it stops at your floor, it does so with a big jerk, signaling that the floor has arrived, without any display inside to indicate which floor you're on. As soon as you step out of the lift, a strong smell of phenyl hits you, making you feel like you're entering a hospital. Then, when the room door opens, it feels like you're entering an old, musty house that hasn't been opened in ages, with a stale smell, cobwebs on the windows and walls, and peeling plaster. I gave it a rating of 1 only because the railway station is a 10-minute walk and the location is decent; otherwise, if negative marking were possible, I would have preferred that. Overall, it was a horrible and terrific experience. Please don't go; after just one night, I was suffocating, so if you're planning to stay for 2-3 days, you'll definitely fall sick.",2024-08-20T08:23:32.059206Z,a year ago

che121,che121_r1,Gan Sri,4,"We had a pleasant stay at this hotel.  They provide good hospitality, and the rooms are spacious. A lift facility is available for all the floors. Parking is not ample, but it can accommodate 5 to 7 cars. Location-wise, it is very near to all the prominent hospitals. The location is safe, and you can get cabs and autos when you step out of the hotel. Rooms are clean and neat, but we did see cockroaches as well. Staff are very courteous, and service is good. The rooms offer a TV, refrigerator, washing machine, geysers, and electric stove. We only used the geyser and TV. The TV was working, and all major channels were available. Although the rooms are spacious, the hotel needs improvements in terms of electrical and washroom fittings. Bathroom fittings are rusted, and the pipe is difficult to open and starts leaking. I have uploaded the images. My feedback has been shared with the hotel staff, and they assured me that these fittings will be replaced. Otherwise, this hotel is good in terms of location and price.

My stay at this hotel room was truly delightful from start to finish. The room was spotless, spacious, and beautifully decorated, providing a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. I particularly appreciated the attention to detail—from the thoughtful amenities provided to the well-maintained furnishings.

The bathroom was impeccably clean, stocked generously with high-quality toiletries and soft towels. Additionally, the room offered a fantastic view, which made my stay even more enjoyable.

Staff members were friendly, accommodating, and professional, ensuring everything exceeded my expectations. I genuinely felt valued as a guest.

We had booked two nights and we extended because we felt good in this hotel ! We were impressed by the quality of the place!

Maintenance of the hotel is incredible: it is the first time that we see a hotel cleaning the banisters, door handles, and the walls of the corridors every day ! The cleanliness of the rooms is identical… they are spacious and they smell good! The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom rather large and with hot water. The standards for travelers are respected (towels, soap, toothbrush, water every day ...) In addition, the staff is great, and very caring ... they will ask you every day if the room needs to be cleaned or the towels changed and we were even upgraded to a larger room!

Thank you again and please, don't change anything!

che126,che126_r1,bharath kumar,2,"**Review: Disappointing Stay at Venture Park – Not Recommended for Families I stayed at Venture Park for 15 days with a group of friends, and unfortunately, our experience was quite disappointing. Here are the key issues we faced during our stay: **1. Poor Air Conditioning and Maintenance** The air conditioning in the room was in terrible condition. It lacked regular maintenance, was full of dust, and didn’t cool the room properly. The remote controls were confusing, with no visible labels or names. Additionally, the AC unit was constantly dripping water inside the room, making the floor wet and uncomfortable. **2. Inadequate Bathroom Privacy** The bathroom windows were oddly positioned and very low. At a height of 5'7"", I felt exposed while using the bathroom as the glass window started around chest level. Although the glass appeared to be frosted, it still didn't offer a sense of proper privacy. This is a serious concern, especially for anyone staying with family. **3. Unprofessional Night Receptionist** The night shift staff was extremely rude and uncooperative. We worked day shifts and returned to the room around 8 PM, and whenever we raised issues, he responded with arrogance and dismissed our concerns. Despite reporting the same problems multiple times, there was no action or support provided. **4. No Refund Policy Made It Worse** We had already paid for the 15 days in full and were told the payment was non-refundable. This left us with no option but to stay, despite the ongoing problems. **Conclusion** Based on my experience, I would not recommend Venture Park, especially for families. It might be tolerable for a short one-night stay with friends, but even then, be prepared for discomfort and lack of service.",2025-06-22T03:33:49.312079063Z,2 months ago

In the morning , another man claiming to be the owner charged us additional amount and made us wait there for one hour, saying that he has called the police. When he found that we weren’t terrified , he approached us more tactically and said that he would charge more if the police comes. But actually he didn’t call the police, but we did. Finally we could escape from that hell only with the help of peryamed police officials who deserve kudos for rendering their immediate presence and action. Please be careful while selecting this hotel . The ac and hot water provisions were not working properly.

che137,che137_r5,sukhchain singh,1,"I had quite a frustrating experience at this hotel. Firstly, the location was a bit of a letdown as it didn't match the one shown on Google. To make matters worse, it's tucked away in a corner where cars can't reach, so you end up lugging your luggage quite a distance.

Moving on to the rooms, I found the quality to be disappointing given the price I paid. The attempt to create a queen-sized bed from two separate ones resulted in a night of constant bed adjustments. Not the ideal sleep experience.

The state of the bathroom was another letdown. Unpleasant smells and an overall lack of comfort made it less than enjoyable.

Perhaps the biggest letdown was the breakfast. I expected a buffet or à la carte options, but I was given just two choices. I opted for Idly, only to find out they sourced it from a nearby restaurant. Not quite what I expected for the price I paid.

Even the basics like bedsheets and pillows were not up to the mark. I could have overlooked some of these issues if I were staying at a more budget-friendly hotel, but shelling out nearly 1500 to 2000 rupees per room made the experience even more disappointing.

180yrs old Muslim Palace they say
The room is filthy you can't even lie down in bed full of bed bags! Cockroach 🪳 , ants and other insects. I got skin itching whole night till I scratched my skin too bad! Bought Cetirizine, Caladryll to heal my itchiness. I should have listened to the other reviews.
Well you get what you paid for 😱
They should renovate the place, change beddings, towels they don't even have toilet paper yikes! The whole place is scary too it's like a haunted house.
Service is also not good. The uncle guy always on the phone he don't listen to your queries he just ignored me when I asked for hot water. There's this caretaker guy who is lovely I forgot his name I think, start with ""J"" he is truly the best to be mentioned here..

One of the biggest advantages is its prime location — it’s very close to the US Consulate, which made my visa appointment stress-free and convenient. The hotel also offers a peaceful atmosphere, good food, and excellent service at a reasonable price. I highly recommend Gulnaar Inn for anyone visiting Chennai, especially for those with consulate appointments or business in the city.""",2025-03-19T08:46:59.842386Z,5 months ago

Pros:The location is really good, looks good. Easy accessibility to shops and restaurants and train stations.
Cons: The rooms are not cleaned properly,lots of cockroaches in rooms and lizards were found in corridors.
The bathrooms needed improvement...the bedsheets and pillow covers were shabby. Lift is conjusted only two ppl can get in.
For a short stay it's okay but prices don't match with the service and quality provided.",2025-07-14T07:39:14.512213029Z,a month ago
che146,che146_r2,Sanket S,1,"Apart from its location, everything else was a disaster. We were exhausted, didn’t have the energy to search, so we blindly booked this hotel—and wow, what a mistake. The moment we opened the door, we were greeted by over 10 cockroaches like they’d been waiting to throw us a welcome party. Bed bugs joined the fun too, just in case we thought we might get some sleep.

The bathroom? No lock. So if you're into public showers with an audience of cockroaches, this is your place. Tried to watch TV to distract ourselves—nope, just one colour: black, with an error message that probably meant “abandon all hope.”

And the blankets? Blood stains. Multiple. We didn’t know whether to sleep or file a crime report. Honestly, if you're looking for a thrill and want to waste ₹2000 a night, go ahead and book this horror movie set. Good luck—you'll need it.",2025-05-06T16:18:45.900658Z,4 months ago

che146,che146_r4,mrunal yelmame,1,"Absolutely disgusting and unsafe – avoid at all costs!""
This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. The place was filthy, with a horrible smell as soon as you walk in. Cockroaches were crawling around everywhere, even in the rooms. The toilets were extremely dirty and clearly hadn't been cleaned properly in ages. To make matters worse, there were weird holes in the bathroom walls, which felt completely unsafe—especially for women. This place is not just unhygienic, it's downright creepy. There are many better and safer hotels in the area—please do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere!

I wish I could give them a negative star!!!!?",2025-05-04T16:47:48.592013Z,4 months ago

che147,che147_r5,Anoop Mathew,1,"1. Though it named as a business hotel, cockrochs are running through the rooms.
2. At night and during rains, smell from the connected ditch is coming to the bathroom and the room.
3. The entrance is narrow and congested. During rains, you can't get there since drainage water flood on the road.
4. No bottled drinking water provided.
5. Find very difficult to collect a GST bill. I had to go after that for an entire day. At the day of checkout, they made me to wait for more than half an hour but still didn't provided and after repeated reminders, somehow I collected the GST bill from them by evening. I believe they don't have a habit of giving GST bill -may be evading the tax.
