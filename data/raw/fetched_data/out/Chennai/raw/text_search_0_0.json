The dinner spread, while decent, leaned more heavily on Indian options.\n\nOne suggestion: While items are clearly labelled with allergen info, I expected clearer separation between vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, especially for people with allergies. For instance, pancakes (with egg) and eggless waffles were placed side by side, with a shared serving tong - increases cross contamination risks. As someone with a severe egg allergy, this was very concerning for me. While the staff always prepared fresh waffles for me on request, the arrangement / layout of dishes didnt change over the 5 days I had breakfast - i expect better allergen awareness and caution from a luxury property.\n\nSpecial mention to Sayantan @ front desk for a smooth experience, Susmita for her personal touch / calls about my experience, Abhisek who served us (during dinner on 7/10). Thanks team!\n\nOverall, it was a memorable stay - but a bit more attention to detail and timely accommodation of guest requests would elevate the experience further!",

My husband, who is English, wasn\u2019t familiar with the various Indian dishes and had his preferences but they were so caring and ensured his every request was catered to. It is senior management such as them who enhance the experience for us customers and keep us coming back.\nWe want to thank Aparajita, Reception Staff who checked us in so smoothly and gave a few gift cards to enjoy in the hotel. Aparajita even walked us to the room to ensure it met with our comfort.She was very engaging, soft spoken, charming and stopped to check on us any time she met us in the foyer.\nAll in all we hardly had any meals outside of this hotel as hygiene was our priority and GRT, Chennai met that. If we visit Chennai again, this definitely be where we will stay!\n\nChandrika & Peter Nelson from Malaysia.",

A special thanks to RINSA & GEETHA & the entire team of waiters for their warm hospitality \u2013 they were polite, attentive, & made our dining experience memorable.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant if you\u2019re a food lover, especially for kebabs. Definitely worth a visit!",

            "text": "An outstanding experience from start to finish at the Hyatt Regency Chennai!\n\nThe hotel is in a prime location \u2014 central, convenient, and easy to get around. The property itself is spacious, clean, and very well maintained, with a strong sense of safety and comfort throughout.\n\nThe rooms are large, spotless, and thoughtfully designed, making for a truly relaxing stay. The dining options are fantastic, with multiple restaurants offering a great variety of delicious cuisines. The bar area is a great highlight, with live performances and a vibrant yet classy atmosphere that adds to the overall experience.\n\nI also made use of the spa and gym facilities, both of which are top-notch. The spa services were excellent, and the gym is well-equipped and clean \u2014 perfect for staying on track while traveling.\n\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the team of people working here. Every single staff member I interacted with \u2014 from the general manager and front desk team, to the concierge, waitresses, housekeeping staff, security guards, chefs, and kitchen team \u2014 was courteous, professional, and genuinely warm. You can tell there is a real culture of hospitality here. Everyone made an effort to ensure guests feel welcome, comfortable, and well cared for.\n\nA big thank you to everyone at the Hyatt Regency Chennai for making my stay so memorable. Highly recommended whether you\u2019re here for business or leisure!",

The food was delicious, and the ambiance of the restaurant was warm and inviting. A special thank you to Executive Chef Shibu for his hospitality and for making us feel so welcome.\n* The rooms were spacious, incredibly comfortable, and always smelled fresh \u2014 such a lovely touch that made our stay even more enjoyable.\n* We especially loved the outdoor terrace in the evenings. My husband and I would unwind there with some amazing mocktails and great music \u2014 it quickly became our favorite spot.\n* The Front Desk team was fantastic and went out of their way to assist us during check-in, especially since we were traveling with my elderly father and had a few special requests. Their care and professionalism really stood out.\n* Location is good though there are no restaurants or malls immediately outside the hotel\n\nHilton Chennai truly knows how to make guests feel special, thanks to a team that embodies the true spirit of hospitality \u2014 warm, courteous, and attentive.\n\nNote: My review comes a bit after our stay, so some aspects may have changed since then \u2014 but the wonderful memories remain just as vivid!",

Spotted a gecko and a cockroach in my room shows how little they care about guests. They only fleece you. Pest control isn\u2019t even a thing here according to the staff\u2019s attitude. Very poor management even though they charge you quite a bit. I\u2019d strongly advise against booking this property.",

His helpful attitude, professionalism, and warm nature truly stood out and made our stay even more memorable.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Taz Kamar Inn to anyone visiting Chennai. Whether you\u2019re here for shopping, business, or family visits, this hotel offers great comfort, value, and excellent service.",

Shops, restaurants, and essential stores are all close by, whatever you need is just a short walk away.\n\nRooms & Amenities:\nThe rooms are excellent. Even the standard category room is spacious and includes a bathtub, which is a rare offering these days. The room features a 50\" TV with OTT platforms already subscribed, a separate coffee table with two chairs, a dedicated work desk with an office chair, and two telephones viz. one near the bed and the other at the work desk.\n\nThe hotel provides all essential toiletries and accessories, along with thoughtful amenities like a bathrobe, slippers, iron with ironing board, hairdryer, and a mini bar. Everything is well maintained and neatly arranged.\n\nDining:\nThe property houses three restaurants. I tried the breakfast buffet and was amazed by the variety, so many options that I couldn't try everything even over a three-day stay! Each dish I tried was delicious and well-prepared.\n\nOn our first evening, we dined at OPM, one of the in-house restaurants. The service was prompt, and the staff was courteous. The food was excellent \u2014 especially the honey-glazed lotus stem starter, which was a unique and memorable dish for me. The ambience was elevated by live singing and soft music, creating a very pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe following evening, we visited the restaurant on the first floor. While the food was fine, the loud sound didn\u2019t suit our mood, so we didn\u2019t stay long.\n\nFacilities:\nI used the gym and swimming pool, which were well-maintained. I couldn\u2019t try the spa, sauna, or steam room this time \u2014 but those are definitely on my list for the next visit.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, The Accord Metropolitan offers a great blend of location, comfort, service, and dining. I highly recommend it for both business and leisure travelers.\n\nThanks for reading! Feel free to check out the photos and do like and follow for more reviews.",

            "text": "The Perfect Grand Finale \u2013 A Royal Experience at The Leela Palace Chennai\n\nAs someone who planned this trip through South India for my wife and in-laws, I really wanted to end it on a high, somewhere luxurious, relaxing, and memorable for the whole family. The Leela Palace Chennai absolutely delivered on every front and then some. It was the perfect send-off to a beautiful journey.\n\nWe stayed in the Royal Club sea-facing rooms, and honestly, they were breathtaking. Watching the sun rise over the Bay of Bengal from our balcony each morning felt surreal, calm, peaceful, and something we\u2019ll never forget. The rooms were beautifully appointed with every detail carefully thought out plush bedding (a pillow menu), luxurious bathrooms, and that view... just wow.\n\nOne of the best parts of the stay was access to the Royal Club Lounge* Each afternoon we\u2019d make our way down for their high tea service, which had the perfect mix of savoury bites, sweets, and warm service. Then in the evening, it was time for cocktail hour, which quickly became our little daily ritual. Special shoutout to Esther, who took incredible care of us every single day. She remembered our preferences, always had a smile, and genuinely made us feel so welcome. Her kindness didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\nBreakfast every morning was another highlight. The buffet was extensive, from South Indian classics like dosas and idlis to international favourites like pancakes and made-to-order eggs. The staff were incredibly attentive, always making sure our table had what we needed, topping up coffee without being asked, and checking in to see if we were enjoying ourselves.\n\nWe also spent an evening at Library Blu, the hotel\u2019s signature bar, and were seriously impressed. The space is beautifully designed, and the cocktails were out of this world, inventive, unique, and packed with flavour. The bartenders clearly take pride in their craft, and every drink was a work of art. We ended up trying a few different options just because everything was so good.\n\nBut what truly made this stay so exceptional was the people. I can\u2019t thank Shomali, the manager, and Karthik, the butler services supervisor, enough. From pre-arrival coordination to last-minute requests, they made sure every little detail was handled seamlessly. They were always available, incredibly responsive, and genuinely cared about our experience.

            "text": "The Perfect Grand Finale \u2013 A Royal Experience at The Leela Palace Chennai\n\nAs someone who planned this trip through South India for my wife and in-laws, I really wanted to end it on a high, somewhere luxurious, relaxing, and memorable for the whole family. The Leela Palace Chennai absolutely delivered on every front and then some. It was the perfect send-off to a beautiful journey.\n\nWe stayed in the Royal Club sea-facing rooms, and honestly, they were breathtaking. Watching the sun rise over the Bay of Bengal from our balcony each morning felt surreal, calm, peaceful, and something we\u2019ll never forget. The rooms were beautifully appointed with every detail carefully thought out plush bedding (a pillow menu), luxurious bathrooms, and that view... just wow.\n\nOne of the best parts of the stay was access to the Royal Club Lounge* Each afternoon we\u2019d make our way down for their high tea service, which had the perfect mix of savoury bites, sweets, and warm service. Then in the evening, it was time for cocktail hour, which quickly became our little daily ritual. Special shoutout to Esther, who took incredible care of us every single day. She remembered our preferences, always had a smile, and genuinely made us feel so welcome. Her kindness didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\nBreakfast every morning was another highlight. The buffet was extensive, from South Indian classics like dosas and idlis to international favourites like pancakes and made-to-order eggs. The staff were incredibly attentive, always making sure our table had what we needed, topping up coffee without being asked, and checking in to see if we were enjoying ourselves.\n\nWe also spent an evening at Library Blu, the hotel\u2019s signature bar, and were seriously impressed. The space is beautifully designed, and the cocktails were out of this world, inventive, unique, and packed with flavour. The bartenders clearly take pride in their craft, and every drink was a work of art. We ended up trying a few different options just because everything was so good.\n\nBut what truly made this stay so exceptional was the people. I can\u2019t thank Shomali, the manager, and Karthik, the butler services supervisor, enough. From pre-arrival coordination to last-minute requests, they made sure every little detail was handled seamlessly. They were always available, incredibly responsive, and genuinely cared about our experience. It honestly felt like we were staying in a palace, but being looked after by family, that\u2019s the kind of warmth and service they provided.\n\nAs the person who organised this trip, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to end it.

Nestled along the serene Adyar estuary and overlooking the Bay of Bengal, the hotel is not just a place to stay\u2014it is an immersive experience in refined grandeur, Southern tradition, and world-class service.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of regal splendor. The architectural elegance of the palace is striking, blending classical South Indian elements with contemporary luxury. High domes, ornate carvings, vast courtyards, and water features create an ambiance of timeless opulence. The check-in process was seamless and discreet, with warm traditional welcomes, refreshing towels, and jasmine garlands\u2014a gesture that immediately set the tone for the days ahead.\n\nI stayed in a Premier Sea View Room, and waking up to the stunning panoramic views of the Bay of Bengal was a highlight every morning. The room was spacious, tastefully furnished, and equipped with every imaginable amenity\u2014plush bedding, a marble bathroom with a soaking tub, high-speed Wi-Fi, mood lighting, and a smart entertainment system. Turndown service was prompt and thoughtful, with personalized touches like hand-written notes and local sweets.\n\nDining at The Leela Palace is nothing short of a gastronomic journey. Spectra, the all-day dining restaurant, offered a global buffet with live counters and impeccable service. Jamavar, their Indian fine-dining restaurant, delivered an exquisite culinary exploration of regional Indian flavors. The chefs were more than willing to customize dishes to my preferences, and the sommelier curated excellent wine pairings with each course. Milled coffee and homemade dosas for breakfast became a daily ritual that I\u2019ll truly miss.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this property is its people. Every staff member\u2014from housekeeping to butlers, spa attendants to restaurant servers\u2014radiated professionalism, warmth, and a deep pride in the Leela legacy. Service was anticipatory without being intrusive, and their attention to detail was flawless.\n\nThe spa deserves special mention. The ESPA therapies, tranquil setting, and seasoned therapists created a sanctuary of relaxation. I also used the pool and fitness center daily, both of which are beautifully maintained and offer calming views of the sea.\n\nSecurity was unobtrusive yet reassuring, ideal for business leaders, celebrities, and international dignitaries who frequent the property. The concierge team was exceptional in organizing meetings, shopping experiences, and guided city tours tailored to my interests.\n\nAfter a week at The Leela Palace Chennai, it\u2019s clear why this hotel remains the gold standard for luxury in South India. It\u2019s not merely the architecture or amenities that make it special, but the harmony of cultural authenticity, heartfelt hospitality, and attention to detail. Whether you\u2019re a discerning traveler, a corporate guest, or a family seeking refined indulgence, The Leela Palace Chennai is an experience that will linger long after you\u2019ve checked out.",

The garden and pool are lovely, with a variety of birds and butterflies along with abundant flowering trees to enjoy. Bala provides outstanding, friendly service at the pool and spa, anticipating every need. He knows we are thirsty or hungry before we do :)\n\nThe spa is a treat, I tried the Balinese service this year and would highly recommend after a long flight. Esther is a great masseuse!\n\nThe food is generally good. Breakfast is a highlight, but the buffet is always solid. The hotel is clean and has a really warm, welcoming feel with beautiful carved wood accents and gorgeous architecture. We look forward to returning for years to come.

The garden and pool are lovely, with a variety of birds and butterflies along with abundant flowering trees to enjoy. Bala provides outstanding, friendly service at the pool and spa, anticipating every need. He knows we are thirsty or hungry before we do :)\n\nThe spa is a treat, I tried the Balinese service this year and would highly recommend after a long flight. Esther is a great masseuse!\n\nThe food is generally good. Breakfast is a highlight, but the buffet is always solid. The hotel is clean and has a really warm, welcoming feel with beautiful carved wood accents and gorgeous architecture. We look forward to returning for years to come. Thanks Trident for the hospitality!",

They made the check-in process seamless and were always available to assist with any queries or requests I had throughout my stay. Their professionalism and dedication truly made a difference in my overall experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food! The hotel boasted some of the best food I have ever tasted, rivaling even the finest 5-star standard restaurants. The variety and quality of the dishes were exceptional, catering to a range of culinary preferences. I was thoroughly impressed with the presentation, taste, and attention to detail in every meal I had.\n\nThe hotel staff baggage carrying staff, wallet parking staffs and cleaning staff including the reception staff and the ladies responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, were outstanding. The bed sheets and towels were of the highest quality, providing a luxurious and comfortable sleep experience. The cleaning staff ensured that my room was always spotless and well-maintained, creating a pleasant and hygienic environment.\nThe amenities, especially the swimming pool and gym, played a major role in maintaining fitness enthusiasm. With state-of-the-art equipment and a variety of exercise options, the gym provided a perfect space for individuals to work on their strength and endurance. The swimming pool, on the other hand, offered a refreshing and low-impact way to stay active and improve my health Additionally, the availability of these amenities made it convenient for people who wanted to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being.\n\nOverall, my stay at Radisson Blue Egmore Chennai was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel provided a truly memorable experience that was worth every penny. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay in Chennai.\nLastly, I would like to suggest that you ask guests upon arrival whether they would prefer smoking or non-smoking rooms according to their requirement.",

ALL of the staff were excellent and provided a level of service and professionalism that I\u2019d associate with a 4-star hotel (whereas IBIS is a 3-star chain).

The property itself is spacious, clean, and very well maintained, with a strong sense of safety and comfort throughout.\n\nThe rooms are large, spotless, and thoughtfully designed, making for a truly relaxing stay. The dining options are fantastic, with multiple restaurants offering a great variety of delicious cuisines. The bar area is a great highlight, with live performances and a vibrant yet classy atmosphere that adds to the overall experience.\n\nI also made use of the spa and gym facilities, both of which are top-notch. The spa services were excellent, and the gym is well-equipped and clean \u2014 perfect for staying on track while traveling.\n\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the team of people working here. Every single staff member I interacted with \u2014 from the general manager and front desk team, to the concierge, waitresses, housekeeping staff, security guards, chefs, and kitchen team \u2014 was courteous, professional, and genuinely warm. You can tell there is a real culture of hospitality here.

Of course, the much-talked-about Hilton Comfort Bed lived up to its reputation with deep sleep guaranteed.\n\nF&B: For food lovers, Hilton Chennai is a hotspot. Their curated food specials, like the Friday seafood buffet and Rajasthani food festivals, are favourites with locals and guests alike. Their stylish, vintage jazz-inspired bar and the buzzing rooftop club by the pool only add to the charm. I recommend increasing menu real estate for local cuisine, supported by staff training on each dish. The regional offerings are unique, and this is a competitive edge few hotels in the area currently doing not have. What made our stay truly memorable was the gold-standard service \u2014 from the efficient front desk to the magical room service team.\n\nSpecial callout to the front desk, the security staff (always with a namasthe and smile), room service Magic and house keeping staff.

Special thanks to Mr.Kaliaperumal and Mr. Yuvraj who went out of their way to get us what we wanted during Breakfast.\n\nThe front office staff were very courteous and helpful.\n\nA memorable stay overall. Will definitely go back there when we travel to chennai",

Whether it was arranging transportation, suggesting local attractions, or simply catering to my preferences, their commitment to customer satisfaction was truly remarkable.\n\nNow let's talk about the food. The hotel's restaurant offered a wide range of delicious dishes that catered to various tastes. Each meal was a culinary delight, showcasing a blend of flavors that left my taste buds wanting more. The presentation was impeccable, and the attention to detail in each dish was evident. Whether I dined in the elegant restaurant or enjoyed a meal at the Japanese restaurant , the experience was always exceptional.\n\nLastly, the rooms at Ilara Hotel and Spa Tada were luxurious and comfortable. The attention to detail in the design and amenities provided a true sense of relaxation. The well-appointed room had all the modern comforts one could ask for, and the view from the balcony was simply breathtaking. I felt pampered and rejuvenated throughout my stay.\n\nOverall, my experience at Ilara Hotel and Spa Tada was nothing short of superb.

They were efficient with the check-in process and provided me with all the necessary information about the hotel's amenities and services. The warm welcome immediately made me feel at home.\n\nThe room itself was spacious, clean, and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable, and the linens were of high quality. I appreciated the attention to detail, with complimentary bottled water and a mini fridge stocked with beverages and snacks. The room also had a desk and a comfortable chair, perfect for catching up on work or simply relaxing after a long day of exploring.\n\nOne of the highlights of the hotel was the stunning view from my room. I was fortunate to have a room with a balcony facing the ocean. Waking up to the sound of waves crashing and enjoying my morning coffee while overlooking the beautiful beach was an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe hotel's amenities were also top-notch. The fitness center was well-equipped with modern machines and provided a great workout experience. The pool area was clean, and the pool attendants were always available to provide fresh towels or assist with any needs. I also made use of the spa services, which were exceptional. The treatments were rejuvenating and left me feeling relaxed and pampered.\n\nThe dining options at the hotel were excellent. The on-site restaurant offered a diverse menu with delicious, freshly prepared meals. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive with a wide variety of options to cater to different dietary preferences. The staff at the restaurant were attentive and friendly, ensuring a delightful dining experience.\n\nWhat truly set this hotel apart, however, was the exceptional level of service provided by the staff. From the moment I arrived until the time I checked out, every staff member I encountered was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to care about making my stay enjoyable. They were always available to answer any questions or provide recommendations for local attractions.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Accord Metropolitan Hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. The combination of outstanding service, comfortable accommodations, and stunning views made it a truly memorable experience. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing stay.",
