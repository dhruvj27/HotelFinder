It\u2019s rare to see such genuine hospitality.\n\nThis place has certainly become a favorite, and I look forward to coming back again with my family.

Unfortunately, the food was a major letdown. Despite the elegant ambience and courteous service, the quality and taste of the food did not meet even basic expectations.\n\nMost of the dishes lacked flavor and freshness. Items that should\u2019ve been served hot were lukewarm, and some preparations seemed either overly salty or bland. For the price point and the Sheraton name, this was truly disappointing.\n\nEven the buffet \u2014 which should ideally be a highlight \u2014 felt uninspired with limited variety and very average taste. It felt more like a rushed spread than a thoughtfully curated experience.\n\nOverall, while the property itself is impressive, the culinary standards do not justify the hype or the price. Definitely not what you\u2019d expect from a 5-star hotel.",

The rooms, while compact, were clean, well-maintained, and offered a beautiful view of Haridwar - ideal for a business/solo stay. The shower area was surprisingly spacious, though I wasn\u2019t a fan of the toilet and washbasin being combined. Still, it served the purpose well!!\n\nA special shoutout to the Duty Manager from the Front Office who spoke to me before check-in; he was extremely kind and thoughtful. Since I had booked the stay as a surprise weekend getaway for my sister after a long work week, he arranged for a lovely handwritten note and a small pastry cake in the room. That personal touch truly made our arrival feel special!!!!\n\nThe gym and pool were great although we wish we had the time to use them!! At the restaurant, the service team was extremely hospitable - staff like Nandini and one more girl whose name I forgot were warm and friendly, and it made breakfast enjoyable. But, this was slightly marred when Subhash interrupted our chat and called them away abruptly, citing \u201cwork,\u201d which felt unnecessary and unprofessional - brief interactions with guests should be welcomed, not shut down!!\n\nThe breakfast had an impressive spread of South Indian dishes, which were delicious. However, the bread section was a letdown - items like the toast, croissants, danish pastries, donuts, pancakes, waffles, and French toast lacked freshness and texture. I do hope they improve this area as they host more than just Indian guests. The chef was kind enough to check in and offer alternatives, which we appreciated!!!\n\nOne area that truly fell short was the handling of my late checkout request. The Front Office Manager Mr. Mallik said he would check and get back to us reg our request while he was checking us in the late evening, but never followed up. When I ran into him the next morning at the lobby, he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all or provide an answer - something as simple as a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d would have sufficed. That lack of basic courtesy was disappointing!!!\n\nDespite these hiccups, the overall vibe of the hotel was good. With a few improvements in professionalism and breakfast variety, it could easily move from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat.\u201d It\u2019s a nice spot for solo travelers - whether for a short trip or an extended work stay!!!!",

I requested two plates for lunch, and despite multiple follow-ups, the plates were brought only after 1.5 hours. This delay forced me to have my lunch at 4 p.m., which was extremely inconvenient and unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.\n\nOverall, the lack of promptness, coordination, and basic service efficiency in both the restaurant and in-room dining was very disappointing.

The spa treatments are relaxing. I especially liked the steam room.  For the classes, I enjoyed the meditation instruction.\n\nCons:\nMy dining experience was subpar. There were few options for a light diet, as I had requested. I ended up just having toast and tea, and no protein options.  I missed the group dining set up from the prior stay, where I got to meet people from around the world. This time, the table set up felt isolating, and meals were quiet and the environment felt somewhat depressing. I learned that the retreat is focusing on treatment and discouraging socializing.\n\nI enjoyed the cottage experience the last time, but there were upkeep issues this time. On my first day, Black ants were crawling on the toilet in my room. It required multiple follow-ups to get a change to a new room.\n\nThe yoga classes were okay. On my last day, I learned from another visitor, that there were more advanced yoga classes.\n\nOverall, this retreat fits boutique, but no longer luxurious, in my experience.",

I liked the Japanese style toilet, but the showers could be improved. The water leaked everywhere due to the wide spray and high pressure shower head. It would get onto the shower curtains, the edges of the bath tub and eventually all over the bathroom floor, then to the corridor and up to the front door!!

The room was decent, though I was initially assigned two single beds instead of my usual preference for a king bed. However, I was later upgraded to a suite.\n\nThe shower lacked a proper screen, causing water to spill out, and the water temperature turned cold after use. The amenities were sufficient but of low quality, such as the toothbrush. The pillows were too soft for my preference, so I had to stack two. The working desk felt cramped in the corner, and the power outlet was inconveniently hidden inside a wooden cabinet\u2014it would be better if it were more accessible.\n\nBreakfast was excellent, especially the Indian food, which I enjoyed the most.

The room was decent, though I was initially assigned two single beds instead of my usual preference for a king bed. However, I was later upgraded to a suite.\n\nThe shower lacked a proper screen, causing water to spill out, and the water temperature turned cold after use. The amenities were sufficient but of low quality, such as the toothbrush. The pillows were too soft for my preference, so I had to stack two. The working desk felt cramped in the corner, and the power outlet was inconveniently hidden inside a wooden cabinet\u2014it would be better if it were more accessible.\n\nBreakfast was excellent, especially the Indian food, which I enjoyed the most.

Right from the express check-in (from lobby to room immediately upon arrival), to the fantastic amenities in the room, to the great dining options - it\u2019s an absolutely delightful experience all-around curated by the staff and management. The people really make this place feel like a home. Every single one of the staff (even the wonderful chefs!) got to know us over our 5 day stay and we became friends. They really do take care of their guests! We left with some amazing stories shared by the staff, and an indelible set of special memories of our stay at The Den! Special thanks to Mr. Amit (Front Desk Manager), Mr. Pradeep Kumar (Service Manager - F&B), Zack (the incredible mixologist at the bar), and everyone at The Den!

Situated amidst the sprawling mega residential township in Whitefield, Bangalore, the resort seamlessly blends luxury with nature, providing guests with an unparalleled experience of relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nDuring my recent stay at Palm Meadows Resort, I had the pleasure of staying in a Superior Twin Bedroom with an attached balcony. The room was spacious, tastefully decorated, and offered breathtaking views of the lush greenery surrounding the property. The balcony provided the perfect spot to unwind and soak in the peaceful ambiance of the resort.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Palm Meadows Resort is its location within the Adarsh Palm Meadows township.

Whether you're looking to relax by the poolside or pamper yourself with rejuvenating spa treatments, Palm Meadows Resort has you covered.\n\nDining at Palm Meadows Resort is a culinary delight, with options to suit every palate. Cafe Palmyra offers an International Culinary theatre experience with both indoor and poolside seating, while Oak Tavern serves up brilliantly crafted cocktails alongside house delicacies. The variety of dining options ensures that guests can indulge in a gastronomic journey throughout their stay.\n\nIn addition to leisure facilities, Palm Meadows Resort also caters to corporate travelers with private meeting rooms, a business center, and a serene atmosphere ideal for conferences and meetings. This versatility makes the resort a popular choice for both leisure and business travelers alike.\n\nDuring my stay at Palm Meadows Resort, a staff member graciously assisted me with tying a knot for a special occasion. Their willingness to help and attention to detail exemplified the exceptional service at the resort. Their kindness made my stay even more memorable. Highly commendable service.\n\nOverall, my experience at Palm Meadows Resort was nothing short of exceptional. From the luxurious accommodations to the impeccable service and serene surroundings, this resort truly lives up to its reputation as a pioneer amongst luxury resorts in the Silicon Valley of India.

I indeed would like to appreciate the entire team of this hotel from top to bottom, along with all management teams, entire ground staffs as well. My family and I had a delightful experience at the hotel from the point of check-in, till checkout. We spent the best time in this hotels in recent holidays . And we really enjoyed a lot. Throughout the entire stay time period, they have just made me to feel like the emperor of that Grand dynasty. Ms. Megha Baidya, Mr. Ajit Anurag,  Mr. Sanjay Gupta, Mr. Subhodeep, other staffs including entire team at Sheraton did a fantastic arrangement for us, arranged a beautiful welcome for us too including bouquet of flowers and many gifts, what they possibly could to make our stay ever-memorable, starting from decorating the room, upgrades, cakes, foods, drinks, balloons, many gifts , flower bookey and so on.. The entire staffs at the hotel are so hospitable, friendly, helpful, humble, cooperative, obedient, dutiful, supportive that I can\u2019t even properly express by my words.  .. although I can only say \"Thanks a ton to all of you, thank you so much for everything.. \" . Furthermore, My Special Sincere thanks to Megha Baidya Madam, for all the efforts and arrangements to make the moments as ever-memorable for us. The suites, rooms with great amenities and the City-view windows were excellent , mind-blowing, incredible, amazing. I must say The Sheraton Grand staff is one of the best, the hospitality and caring I had received during our recent stay. Fantastic hospitality at Feast which is one of the restaurants at this Sheraton. We had breakfast included as part of our stay and there was a large variety of delicious food on offer for breakfast and all hosts looked after us extremely well during breakfast, lunch, dinner including excellent within room dine-in service. A very enjoyable experience! The check in and check out were very efficient, smooth and very quick. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The welcome back note was a very nice gesture. The room service was very prompt and the food was very good. The breakfast spread was good and the food was of very good quality too. Overall I had a very good stay at this hotel. Moreover, I would like to express my great appreciation to the team in the club lounge for their excellent service provided to me during my stay here in Sheraton Grand. They make me feel like home every time I visited the club lounge, including the awesome services during happy hours. I can feel their passion in their job. They always stop by and talk to me really help me relax and did not feel alone. The food they offer in the club lounge during happy hours is very delicious. I also would like to thank Housekeeping Manager, Room Service Manager and entire team members for providing their best services, always.. Their service is outstanding and extraordinary and amazing. Last but not least, I would like to express my upmost gratitude to Ms. Megha, Mr. Neeraj Lumb, Mr. Shubham Raj, Mr. Anil , Mr. Deepak, Mr. SubhraDev, Mr. Vikky, Ms. Mausami, Ms. Abhipriya, Mr. Dinesh, Mr. Subhodeep, Mr. Janesh, Ms. Sapna, Mr Saurabh, Mr. Subhradev, Ms. Chaya, Mr. Avinash and team,  for everything, as you people really deserve many appreciations.",

The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the city, making it convenient for exploring. A shopping mall is just 4 km away, which is great for a quick shopping trip.\n\nThe restaurant serves a fantastic selection of international cuisine, including vegan and gluten-free options, catering to all dietary preferences. The rooms have a warm and welcoming feel, with thoughtful touches like hot chocolate and soaked almonds for a healthy snack. The amenities are top-notch, with high-quality bath products from a well-known brand, and the bed and pillows are incredibly comfortable\u2014I slept like a dream on the crisp, white sheets!\n\nHousekeeping was exceptionally attentive, ensuring a spotless and comfortable stay. Every evening, the rooftop hi-tea was a lovely experience, offering a splendid view of the city. The F&B staff were super helpful and even took beautiful pictures of guests at the rooftop, adding a special touch to the experience.\n\nThe in-room dining service was prompt, and I highly recommend trying the Hakka prawn noodles and the soothing turmeric milk\u2014both were absolutely delicious! One of the most thoughtful touches was the 15-minute foot massage teaser, which was a blessing after a long flight. They also offer 15% off on full-body massages, and I must say, it was one of the best I\u2019ve had in India\u2014incredibly relaxing, and the head massage worked wonders for my migraine!\n\nOverall, Radisson Bengaluru City Center exceeded my expectations with thoughtful hospitality, luxurious comfort, and outstanding service.

He was courteous and professional, and he made sure that all of my requests were taken care of promptly. His attention to detail was remarkable, and it was evident that he takes great pride in his work.\nSakshi was also an outstanding professional.
