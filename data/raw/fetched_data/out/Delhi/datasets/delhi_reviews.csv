They are not only warm and polite but also incredibly thoughtful and attentive, especially when it came to my birthday, they surprised me with a cake without us even mentioning it showing how sensitive and attentive they are to details. These gestures only show how well-trained they are by their management, and it truly shines through. The hotel is not only centrally located but also offers easy access to most attractions and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is delightful. The chef even came around to ask if we enjoyed our meal, which made us feel truly pampered. I highly recommend this hotel for an exceptional experience!",2025-08-05T16:03:01.476007278Z,a month ago
del001,del001_r2,Alex Klein,1,"Appalling and Shameful service from Staff I stayed at The Lalit Hotel in New Delhi for four days it was my first time visiting the city. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a great location. It’s clean, the rooms are lovely, and from a physical and design standpoint, it meets the standard of what you’d expect from a luxury property.

But sadly, my experience was affected by the service, particularly from the restaurant staff. I want to be fair hotel staff around the world are usually warm, professional, and kind. But during my stay, I couldn’t ignore how I was treated, especially compared to other guests. Being a person of color, I felt I was treated differently, and that feeling was hard to shake. I don’t know if it’s a cultural issue or something else, but it was clear that white guests were given noticeably better service.

One example: I was seated at breakfast at a table that still had dirty glasses and utensils from a previous guest. No one came to clean it or offer fresh cutlery. Meanwhile, a white guest seated right before me was shown to a fully set, clean table without delay. That kind of disparity is hard to overlook, especially in a hotel that calls itself five-star.

Experiencing this type of treatment made me feel uncomfortable and, frankly, discriminated against. It’s disappointing, because this hotel has so much potential but service like that falls far below the standard that should come with the rating and price tag.

If The Lalit wants to be a truly world-class hotel, it needs to ensure all guests are treated with equal respect and dignity regardless of skin color or nationality.

It prides itself in being LGBT Friendly, I am part of that community, Not because you employ LGBT individuals means you are respectful and professional. Its a shame BUT I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN OR never RECOMMEND ANYONE too",2025-07-18T20:08:59.178445330Z,a month ago

del001,del001_r4,Asif Qureshi,1,"Worst 5 star Hotel I have ever stayed at.

I stayed over for 3 nights. Checked in to my room. As soon as I entered, it felt claustrophobic with no Window. just a small piece of glass cut out in a corner with the most horrible view ever.
I went to reception to ask for a different room. Unfortunately, not very helpful, and started to question me that he cant believe that I dont like the room. Then my only option was to get an Exec room, which was an upgrade that I got by paying 5K per night extra.
Now second part: I am laying in my bed. and I heard someone open my door at 10:45pm. Apparently they double booked the room I was in. I see an older gentleman walking in, as he got assigned the same room. He was so embarassed. We both went down to reception. Again just a Low valued apology was given, while looking at a computer screen. Nobody cared of what had just happened. No compensation was provided.
Third: The Hygiene: Well I have attached pictures of cockroach infestation. So bad customer service, and low quality room was not enough. I was greeted with Cockroaches in the dim lighted bathroom.

Again, MOST HORRIBLE PLACE TO STAY AT. there is noting 5-star about it. Take your business somewhere else.",2025-08-19T09:42:39.202426125Z,2 weeks ago

del002,del002_r2,Tatheer Tasneem Khan,2,"Stayed here for a night with a small child alongside during my transit to USA. Booked it for Raddison 's name and expected some standards. Made a booking thru booking.com and had requested early check in well in advance over call and in writing from the property  which I totally understand was subject to availability. The standard time was 3.00 pm. but instead they gave an exhausted me the room with amenities mentioned in booking, close to 4 pm and that too as if they were doing a favor. Not mentioning names here but some of the front desk staff were appallingly haughty. A select few did extend genuine help. There were two things I specifically noticed about this place: I asked for two room keys (even if one of them deactivated) so I can keep the lights on for my child in room, in case I needed to step out for a wee bit, but they wouldnt give it as if I were asking for a treasure. Asked me to  'come back later' for it. Then I specifically noticed a bias in which they were sweet to foreigners and would happily let them check out with just a key drop but made us stand for long, for check out because they were 'checking our rooms' despite handing them card details and reporting minibar usage upfront. Why do not these people understand that business they get through people is what pays their salary irrespectively and that they are not there to judge or discriminate but render services and equally so? Upon complaining, they did give me extended check out hours, a complimentary cab to airport and a promise to upgrade to suite next time but will there be a next time now? Does this payment undo our distasteful  experience? Raddison is not a one night stand hotel but a dignified name.They should stop giving preferential treatment to customers of their choice and render services they have promised. Or maybe, just stop overcommitting.The management needs to train employees better in handling customer needs and esp do something about their biased behaviour. Customer's satisfaction and loyalty are not bought by hand outs but warm welcome, a comfortable stay and a stress free check out. So, I'm thoroughly disappointed.",2025-08-17T03:40:25.285657992Z,2 weeks ago

del004,del004_r1,Debanshu Banerjee,1,"I had an awful experience staying at HOTEL O’ Delhi, Karol Bagh (Room 304). Here’s why:
•	No electricity from 3:00 AM to past 4:30 AM in peak summer heat — absolutely unacceptable.
•	A random staff member entered our room in the middle of the night for some machine issue that wasn’t even related to our room. Completely unprofessional and disturbing.
•	No response to calls — had to call six times before anyone picked up.
•	Water facilities were poor: flush and basin barely worked.
•	The room had no proper lock, a basic safety necessity, and even after informing them three times, no action was taken.

Extremely poor management, zero sense of guest comfort, and no responsibility for guest safety. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Please avoid if you value your peace, hygiene, and safety.",2025-06-11T23:26:05.175380295Z,2 months ago

The room key card didn’t work 2 days in a row, the first day we were told to keep it away from phones and electronics and we did that still the second day, same problem! After an entire day of sightseeing, you finally approach your room to crash, only to find out that you need to go back down again to activate your card.

However, I was a bit disappointed with the buffet spread. As someone who has worked in the F&B department myself, I understand the effort that go into maintaining a buffet.

The bathroom quality was especially poor. Shockingly, there was a visible gap even when the door was shut, so someone in the bedroom could still see inside. After showering, the water didn’t drain properly and kept collecting in the shower area, which was very unhygienic.

Room service was extremely careless and slow. When I requested a towel and dental kit, it took them almost an hour to deliver it to the room. Overall, the room standard was nowhere close to what they claim.

When I raised the issue, instead of showing urgency or basic professionalism, the management behaved casually and did not take responsibility. Serving undercooked food with blood is beyond unhygienic—it is dangerous.

Shockingly, none of the staff or security present intervened. I had to drive away to protect myself. When I returned and reported it, the manager was rude and dismissive, saying the woman wasn't their guest. Later, my phone complaint to the concierge wasn’t taken seriously either.

This was a serious breach of security and guest safety. The staff's complete lack of action was unacceptable.",2025-07-19T23:34:48.202283111Z,a month ago

del009,del009_r4,Meghana,3,"My stay was generally okay, but I'd like to share some feedback, particularly regarding the front desk staff. Two of the female staff members could benefit from basic etiquette training. While I understand the importance of rest and breaks, it's equally important to ensure adequate staffing-especially during peak check-in hours.

Despite having four counters, only two were operational around the 2:30 PM check-in time, resulting in long queues. I approached the third counter where one of the female staff was attending guests. Just as it was my turn, she abruptly left for a break without any courtesy or communication, forcing me to join another line.

The next counter was attended by a lady who was warm and welcoming to a foreign guest. However, when it was my turn, her demeanor changed noticeably-no smile, no courtesy. It felt quite dismissive.

During checkout the next day, overheard the other staff again requesting to be relieved early, which gave the impression that she was more focused on taking breaks than assisting guests.

On a positive note, the dining staff were excellent. Special mention to Tanvi, who was attentive, courteous, and truly made the dining experience pleasant.",2025-08-06T05:18:26.320211231Z,a month ago

The check-in process was smooth though initial delay was there but was well managed by the front office Staff. They were very courteous and helpful. During peak hours the check-in process is a bit longer than expected.
The hotel staff is professional, very responsive, and they ensure that every detail is taken care of by them.
The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. And it had all the basic amenities required.
The Cafe Pride and Oriental Spice restaurant are nice and spacious and serve delicious food. And offer  well spread and extensive buffet breakfast and dinner with numerous options to satisfy your taste buds. Though it gets a bit crowded during breakfast time and one must wait to get a table during the peak breakfast time.
The conference halls are spacious and are well equipped. However, the issue of mosquitoes is there in the conference hall though they did try to take care of the same by still this needs to be taken care of by the Hotel Management

The location of the hotel is also quite convenient, especially for business travelers, with easy access to nearby commercial hubs and the airport. The facilities like the gym and spa were well-kept, and the common areas, including the lobby, had a premium feel.

However, the one area that fell short of expectations was the food. The variety was limited, and the taste did not quite match the standard set by the rest of the hotel. Whether it was the breakfast buffet or the in-room dining options, the flavors lacked richness and authenticity. For a hotel of this standard, I had expected better culinary quality.

They do not offer drinks and are not helpful. We would have liked to have a glass of wine with dinner, but we did not have the opportunity to do so. The hotel also offers conference facilities and it is very frustrating that almost exclusively men who are thought to be dressed walk around the hotel, take pictures of each other and occupy the elevators at almost all hours of the day, reacting aggressively if the elevator does not go where they want.

You should know that this hotel does not accept the international card, payment only in cash for foreigners who do not have a indian card. And obviously this detail was not indicated. It is important to specify it knowing that it is located in an airport area of the capital of India, so a lot of tourists.

The room, a disaster. Far from a 4 stars and its standing, even for India. Already the connected lock with card entry, does not work, so they installed a push button lock (which is half broken). Also, the walls are in poor condition (see photos)

Then the room is very old, half torn curtain, stained cushions, dirty floor.

Very old bathroom, with moldy shower head. Nothing positive. For me it is not a real 4 star compared to other 4 stars (cheaper) that I have frequented and that looked like a high-end palace with beautiful rooms.

1. Due to an odd flight timing, I reached the hotel around 8 AM. The receptionist asked me to either wait or pay ₹1000 extra for early check-in. While this is common practice, the attitude felt more like taking advantage of a guest’s situation than offering genuine hospitality.

2. Main Concern – At 11 AM, my second guest arrived. I went to the reception to collect the room key. The receptionist handed it over without asking for my guest’s ID. Later, he called me rudely, blaming me for not providing the ID, and ordered me to come to the reception immediately to submit it. This tone and behavior were completely unprofessional.

3. This hotel is not value for money. With the same budget, you can easily find better properties with trained, educated staff who know how to treat guests with respect.

I honestly don’t understand how this hotel maintains a 5-star rating—feels like the reviews are manipulated.

The location of The Ashok Hotel, New Delhi is undoubtedly brilliant, offering a grand view and a central position that is convenient for business and leisure travelers alike.

The service quality was average, with staff support not meeting expectations of a five-star property. The buffet food was also average, lacking variety and the finesse one would expect.

del026,del026_r1,Srijana Pradhan,2,"Please Choose Wisely!
I am not someone who is critical of my stays because I do a lot of traveling and have come across some of the worst and best hotels in all these years.
However, what really pisses me off is the way sometimes hotel employees take customers for granted and try to slide in cheaper quality for higher prices.
Context: I was here only for 3 and a half hours of rest as my international flight was 8 hrs later. I had already travelled two flights (super tired) and wanted a place to freshen up and stretch my legs a bit. I also requested for a room with table and chair so I could send out some emails meanwhile.
When I arrived, I was given a Rs.2000 booking for 3 and a half hrs, so I hoped it was going to be a comfortable stay. To my surprise, they gave me a really shoddy looking room, with extremely small space and it smelt bad! I'm damp allergic so I smelt it right away, also, the room wasn't deep cleaned.
I called the reception immediately and challenged their choice of room for Rs.2000 (only for a few hrs). They then shifted me to a bigger room, with enough walk space and it wasn't smelling bad, either. Which means, they could've given me that room in the first go, but they tried their luck with a tiny room (which could've costed way less for 3hrs).
I ordered food, which was in good quantity but the quality was average. I wasn't expecting a lot, so no complaints there.
But, I couldn't really bring myself to use the bathroom for a shower or change clothes to sleep for even an hour! I just went in with the same clothing and napped for, what could've been a 10-15 mins, only.

The hotel admin and heads should really work on these things, because there are plenty of hotels around as a competition and the last thing a customer would want to fight about is the value for money and cleanliness. I was more concerned about getting a good rest, which obviously wasn't possible here.
Moreover, I also felt that being a single person (a girl) coming with her luggage was enough for them to assume that I will be OKAY with whatever they gave me.
Well.. sorry to disappoint you.

I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Okhla and had a truly wonderful experience. From check-in to departure, the hospitality and professionalism of the staff stood out. The hotel is ideally located for business travelers, with easy access to Noida, Nehru Place, and Jasola, yet it still offers a peaceful and comfortable retreat from the city’s hustle.

The room was spacious, well-maintained, and beautifully designed with all modern amenities. I especially appreciated the thoughtful touches like a separate shower and toilet area, which added to the comfort. The housekeeping was prompt and attentive throughout the stay.

Dining was another highlight — breakfast was exceptional, with a wide variety of Indian and international options. The South Indian dishes and fresh juices were particular favorites. I also enjoyed dinner at Edesia, which offered both great food and ambiance.

Facilities like the rooftop pool and gym were well-kept and provided a relaxing escape after long meetings. I also loved the cake shop for quick snacks and sweet treats.

Overall, Crowne Plaza Okhla delivers the perfect blend of comfort, service, and convenience. Highly recommended for both business and leisure travelers!",2025-05-13T11:51:25.098651Z,3 months ago

Our group of senior management had just checked in when, at the reception, one of the staff members took a phone call on speaker volume so loud that everyone around could hear. What followed was shocking..he began hurling abuses and ranting, while the other person on the line remained calm and dignified.
The issue appeared to be service related, but out of nowhere, the staff member demanded the caller’s credit card details. When the caller refused, he escalated further, using offensive language and even threatening physical violence inside the hotel premises. Shockingly, he went as far as saying that he would enter every guest room, pull the person out, and “beat him to death.”
Such behavior is not only unprofessional but also a serious security concern for all guests staying at the property. It raises a troubling question..why does Lemon Tree employ such staff? The place felt glorified roadside lodge.

They have 3 or 4 lifts, but there’s no proper guidance. You literally have to search for the right lift just to reach the first floor! One lift goes to stay-in guest rooms, another one goes to the eatery area on the 2nd floor, and yet another one takes you to the bridal room or banquet. It’s unnecessarily complicated.

During the last wedding I attended, we went up and down twice using the same lift but still couldn’t find the one that goes to the first floor! It gets even more difficult when you’re wearing heavy outfits—climbing stairs isn’t ideal at such events.

The hotel really needs to simplify their lift system and provide clear directions for guests. Also, their room service is extremely slow, and the receptionist’s behavior was very rude, which is honestly not acceptable in the hospitality industry.

From the moment we entered the property, everything felt top-notch. The staff was super polite, professional, and always ready to help with a smile. The ambiance of the hotel is luxurious yet welcoming. Our room was spacious, spotless, and had a beautiful city view.

What truly stood out was the poolside area : peaceful, clean, and perfect for relaxing. Breakfast had a huge spread with both Indian and continental options, and everything tasted fresh and delicious.

We also appreciated the little thoughtful touches : quick check-in, smooth service, and free parking. The location is also excellent for getting around Delhi.

del038,del038_r4,Nandan,4,"A decent airport hotel that offers good value for quick layovers, though not without its quirks. The Royal Inn IGI provides reliable accommodation just a short taxi ride from Delhi's international terminal, making it particularly convenient for those early morning flights.

While the rooms are admittedly compact - perhaps too snug for extended stays - they're well-maintained and equipped with the essentials. The washroom facilities need attention, particularly the drainage system which can be problematic. However, the helpful staff are quick to address issues when raised.

The hotel's strongest point is its efficient front desk service. Check-in is seamless, and the team demonstrates genuine willingness to accommodate guest requests. The complimentary airport transfers are a welcome touch, though it's wise to confirm timing in advance.

The in-house dining options are surprisingly good for a transit hotel, serving decent Indian and Continental fare. While not luxurious, the overall cleanliness and service quality make it a practical choice for brief stays near IGI airport.

Worth noting: Best suited for solo travellers or couples; families might find the room size restrictive.",2025-04-09T10:28:16.477491Z,4 months ago
del038,del038_r5,Sozo Manu Vlogs,4,"I recently stayed at Hotel Royal Inn IGI and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the hotel's location is excellent, with easy access to the airport. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was spacious.
However, there were a couple of drawbacks that prevented me from giving a higher rating. Firstly, the cleanliness of the room could have been better. There were some dust and stains on the furniture and floor.

Secondly, the fan in the room was quite noisy, which made it difficult to sleep at night. I had to switch it off, which made the room a bit warm. So make sure you get a good room before check-in.

We had breakfast and dinner at this hotel. The breakfast was freshly cooked and served on the table however there was a big letdown at dinner. Their 400rs biryani was not worth it.  The food seems to be more stale and insipid. We didn't like it at all. So I won't recommend having dinner here.

Despite these issues, I would still recommend Hotel Royal Inn IGI to travelers looking for a convenient and affordable place to stay. With a bit of improvement in cleanliness and maintenance, this hotel could be a real gem.",2025-03-31T07:32:16.084147Z,5 months ago

However, there were a couple of areas that could use some improvement. The swimming pool, though beautifully designed, was not as clean as expected from a hotel of this caliber. A bit more attention to maintenance here would go a long way. Additionally, while breakfast had a decent spread, it lacked the quality and variety usually associated with five-star hospitality.

del041,del041_r2,Karan Bajaj,4,"I recently stayed at Hotel Viva Palace and would describe the experience as decent for the price point. Initially, I was given a room where the AC was quite noisy and the direct sunlight made the room very warm, which affected the cooling. However, upon requesting a change, the staff promptly shifted me to a better room which was more comfortable.

One thing that stood out (and not in a great way) was that cold water is chargeable—even during peak summer—which felt a bit unreasonable, especially when you're already provided complimentary regular water. It would be great if the hotel considered including cold water as part of the basic amenities, at least during the hotter months.

Breakfast was decent with enough variety to satisfy most guests, though it’s best not to compare it with a 5-star buffet. The in-room food service was on the slower side, but the housekeeping staff were quite cooperative and attentive to our needs, which helped improve the overall experience.

In summary, it feels like a solid 3-star hotel experience. If the management wants to maintain or justify a 4-star label, there’s definitely room for improvement—particularly in service efficiency and guest comfort standards. Still, it’s a reasonable stay for the price.",2025-06-13T07:06:12.875952Z,2 months ago

✅ Positives:
- The rooms were clean and well-maintained.
- Staff service was courteous and responsive, which made the stay pleasant.
⚠️ Areas for Improvement:
- The washrooms had water leakage issues, leading to stagnation — this needs urgent attention for hygiene and safety.
- During the complimentary breakfast, I noticed small cockroaches on the table, which was quite off-putting.
- The breakfast is priced at ₹300, which feels steep considering the limited variety and quality offered. It comes across as a budget spread, so either the pricing or the offerings should be reconsidered.
💡 Overall: The hotel has potential with its clean rooms and good staff service, but it needs to improve its maintenance and food hygiene standards to offer better value for money",2025-07-18T06:47:13.203936425Z,a month ago

However, what truly stood out and elevated the experience was the food quality and the prompt room service. The meals were flavorful, well-prepared, and consistently delivered hot and on time. The kitchen and service staff deserve credit for their efficiency and attentiveness.

This place is a decent option if you're looking for a short stay and prioritize good food and quick service over room size and amenities. A little improvement in room comfort could make this a much stronger contender.",2025-06-20T06:14:41.814536048Z,2 months ago

del042,del042_r5,S Carra G,1,"We were really disappointed with our stay at this hotel, which calls itself a Traveller’s Choice 2025. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to that title at all.

Even before check-in, staff pressured us to cancel our pre-booked Agra tour and use their in-house driver instead, claiming our original company was unsafe and unreliable as they would scam us and said the drivers were “drunks” which turned out to be completely untrue. Our independent tour went perfectly.

We did end up booking the hotel’s driver for two days to show us a bit of Delhi(for around £120) but after just one day, we decided not to continue. The whole experience felt uncomfortable. He made decisions without asking us, charged us for his own entry tickets and a tuk-tuk ride we didn’t agree to, and took us to shops we had no interest in — clearly to earn commission. At the end of the day, after we tipped him, he locked the car doors and refused to let us out until we gave him more money, saying the tip “wasn’t enough.” It was stressful and honestly quite humiliating.

We asked the hotel for a refund for the second day we didn’t use the driver, but they refused and didn’t seem to care about what had happened.

On top of that, the room we were “upgraded” to was right above the lobby — it was noisy day and night, with traffic, loud staff conversations, and slamming doors. The TV didn’t work for several days, even after we asked multiple times.

The only positive part of our stay was a few of the staff we met at dinner — they were kind, helpful, and provided great service.

Overall though, the experience felt unprofessional and exhausting. We work hard to travel, and this stay left us feeling taken advantage of. We wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.",2025-06-23T12:59:54.129001822Z,2 months ago

We really enjoyed our time here. The staff were outstanding. So friendly, attentive, and genuinely helpful. On our first evening, we were warned by hotel staff about common scammers outside the hotel. This was invaluable, as we were approached by someone pretending to be from the hotel, telling us Connaught Place was closed and offering to “show us the way.” Thanks to the staff’s advice, we didn’t fall for it. That thoughtfulness set the tone for our stay.

Special mention to the young lady and gentleman in the Grappa Bar, who were especially welcoming and the cleaner at the entrance who always smiled and said hi and would dry the seating near the smoking area so we could sit.

The hotel itself is very well maintained and extremely clean, even if some areas of the rooms felt a little dated in their decor. The gym and sauna were a highlight – spotless, peaceful, hi-tech, modern and again with excellent staff support.

If I could suggest one improvement, it would be the in-room coffee. As someone who needs a proper coffee before starting the day, I would have loved to see a coffee machine or at least higher-quality coffee bags rather than instant sachets. For a luxury property, this small detail would really make a difference.

The hotel itself is okay for short stays—more suited for solo travelers rather than families or couples.

The room had the basic essentials, but nothing too fancy. I found the overall vibe of the hotel just decent. One thing to note: food from the in-house restaurant is quite expensive for what it offers.

That said, the breakfast buffet was surprisingly good—definitely don’t skip it if it's included in your stay.

I had a very disappointing stay at urban tree Hotel. The air conditioning was not working, and to make matters worse, the ceiling fan was barely running, making the room extremely uncomfortable. Despite raising the issue with the staff multiple times and requesting a room change three times, nothing was done to resolve it.

The worst part of the stay was the electric shock I received in the bathroom, apparently due to a faulty geyser. This was extremely dangerous and completely unacceptable.

The staff seemed unresponsive and unwilling to help, which only added to the frustration. I strongly advise others to avoid this hotel unless these serious issues are addressed.

Despite this, they had the audacity to call me at 6:30 PM to inform me that I had to vacate immediately because another guest was lined up for the same room. They couldn’t even accommodate me for an extra 15 minutes.

I recently stayed at Eros Hotel, and overall, it was a pleasant experience. The hotel's amenities and services were top-notch, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.

The swimming pool was great, with a slope depth that made it suitable for swimmers of all levels. I loved the classic and vintage vibes at the hotel, which added to the overall ambiance and made my stay even more memorable. The hotel rooms themselves had a beautiful vintage look, which perfectly complemented the overall aesthetic of the hotel.

However, one thing that caught me off guard was the prices of items kept in the room. A small packet of peanuts (about 100mg) that normally costs around ₹30 was charged at ₹300! That's a hefty markup, to say the least.

Apart from this, everything else about the hotel was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient.

I'm writing to formally complain about Ashok Country Resort. I want to warn future customers who are thinking of staying there because their services are very bad.
They only give two small water bottles for each room. If you need more water, you have two bad choices: you either have to pay ₹84 for a tiny 500ml bottle, or they give you an unsealed, used water bottle.
When I asked about the used bottle, the person at the front desk actually said, without any shame, ""Sir, we have washed this bottle and filled the water."" This means they are taking bottles that other guests have used, washing them, refilling them, and then giving them to new guests to drink from.
This practice is very unhealthy and dangerous. What if the person who used the bottle before had a serious sickness? They just wash it and give it to you to drink from. This is completely wrong and risky for customers' health.
I am sharing my personal experience with DLF Club 3, as they provide best-in-class services. This serves as a recommendation for those who wish to invest the same amount of money and receive superior service.

The only thing I would suggest improving is the hallways — they were quite dim and could benefit from better lighting.",2025-07-18T16:27:37.571468390Z,a month ago

del055,del055_r3,Pj Dhaliwal,4,"We had a great experience at this hotel, which boasts an excellent location right in Connaught Place, Delhi. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to be close to all the action and easily explore the city.

While the rooms are on the smaller side (expected given the prime location), they were comfortable and well-maintained. The staff was very cordial and attentive, always willing to help, which made our stay more enjoyable.

One downside is the lack of private hotel parking. Be aware that parking nearby can get expensive, so it’s best to plan accordingly if you’re bringing a vehicle.

The in-house restaurant was good enough, and there are plenty of dining options around to explore, so you’ll never go hungry! It’s true that the area can be a bit noisy, but we came prepared with earplugs, which helped a lot.

del056,del056_r2,Paul Gillingham,4,We stayed here for one night earlier this year before catching a plane early the next day. We had originally booked another hotel that was cheap but turned out to be in a bit of a rough area. I wasn't sure I would like the whole secure airport zone vibe but actually after a week of being hassled to varying degrees it was nice to be in an area where you were left alone. Booked a transfer with them which was on time without problems. More expensive than other hotels we had booked but it was a welcome break.,2025-08-27T15:53:40.936662913Z,a week ago
del056,del056_r3,Samapan - Sam Sarkar,5,"The Red Fox by Lemon Tree can be confused with Lemon Tree Premier as it shares the same building - one at the front and the other at the side. However, both are a part of the Lemon Tree group of hotels. By the name you can differentiate the affinity crowd pulled by the Lemon Tree Premier. In services, room quality, cooperative and hospitality, add ons, both have a high standard of quality.

The room that I booked was a standard room with queen sized bed, washroom, a comfy chair, a table where you can work from, standard chair for work, shower room segregated from the washroom/ basin area, electric kettle, drinking water and glasses, and the standard coffee cups with tea, coffee, and different types of sugar options.

Special callout for Shivani (manning the reception desk), Alam who held on to my niche NG Ear Safe bluetooth headset at the front desk and Manoj Kumar (security guard) who picked up my headset which I dropped while getting into the cab and deposited it at the front desk.

That is true service because anyone, Manoj or Alam, could have quietly kept it without me knowing where I had dropped it. Kudos to these individuals who understand and stand by their values and ethics.

The Red Fox Cafe at the ground floor serves excellent buffet dinners. I can speak only about dinner as I ate here. The food was awesome, the servers great, and also got a moment to talk of the chef who was behind the delectable spread.

As the location is within a stone throw from the IGI Airport it is truly a convenient place to stop by before catching an early morning flight ✈️. Highly recommended to those between layovers, connecting flights, early morning/ late night flights, etc.",2025-04-22T07:27:16.107369Z,4 months ago
del056,del056_r4,Guddu Sharda,5,"We stayed at the Red Fox Lemon Tree Hotel for a night and were genuinely impressed with the overall experience. I'd like to share some feedback from our stay, beginning with the only minor downside – the rooms are quite compact. For guests traveling with large international luggage, managing space might be a bit challenging.

That said, everything else was absolutely top-notch. Starting with the front desk – during a busy check-in time, we experienced a bit of a wait, but the night front desk associate kindly offered us complimentary dinner. I’m not sure if it was extended to all guests, but it was a thoughtful gesture and truly appreciated.

The next morning, we were blown away by the warm hospitality at breakfast. A huge shoutout to Shivaangi and Kanwaljeet, who went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. After a long international journey and with more travel ahead, we were exhausted – but their kindness made a big difference. They not only helped us with food options but also provided me with a Move spray for my back pain, which was incredibly thoughtful.

We were really touched by the staff’s genuine care and exceptional customer service. Thank you, Shivaangi and Kanwaljeet, for making our stay memorable. We’ll definitely be back again because of the lovely hospitality!

I had a wonderful experience staying at this hotel conveniently located near the railway station. From the moment I arrived, the staff was warm, welcoming, and always ready to assist with a smile. The check-in process was quick and hassle-free, which was perfect after a long train journey.

The room was clean, spacious, and well-furnished with all the essential amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was inside the room despite being so close to the station.

The location is incredibly convenient—just a short walk from the railway station, making it ideal for travelers who want easy access to transport. There are also plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.

del058,del058_r1,Sameera Omar Bin Mahfouz,1,"A Deeply Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Price

I typically refrain from writing negative reviews, but my recent overnight stay left me with no choice. The experience was deeply unsettling, not just due to poor service, but because of what appeared to be discriminatory behavior based on religion. When my mother politely requested a simple box to store some fruit—due to our early flight the next morning—the dining hall staff chose to ignore her completely. No explanation, no courtesy—just blank stares and people walking away. It felt intentionally dismissive.

The rudeness of the dining staff was unlike anything I’ve experienced before. Other staff members throughout the hotel were at least civil, but the dining team’s behavior stood out in the worst way.

To make matters worse, the facilities themselves were inexcusable given the price point. The bathroom was extremely small and not clean, and the electrical plugs in the room didn’t even function properly. It felt like a budget motel at luxury rates.

A place that treats guests with such disregard, particularly when basic courtesy is requested, doesn’t deserve return business. I sincerely hope the management addresses the apparent staff bias and elevates the standard of both hospitality and cleanliness.",2025-07-17T06:37:34.871191151Z,a month ago

A hotel is primarily for getting a hot shower and a good night of sleep. Our first room they gave us the ac didn’t work. They sent a maintenance guy who glanced at it and said wait ten minutes for it to “work”. After ten minutes we went down and got them to give us a new room. They wanted to send the guy again but we pressed for a new room. To their credit they gave it to us. New one seemed better so we got settled in and I got in the shower. No hot water… like seriously that’s a hotel’s primary utility. We were tired so just gave up and went to bed.

During my recent stay at the hotel, one of the standout aspects that truly elevated the entire experience was the exceptional hospitality and professionalism of the hotel staff. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine sense of welcome that instantly made me feel at home.
The front desk team was incredibly efficient and courteous, ensuring a smooth check-in process and readily answering all my questions with patience and clarity. They went above and beyond to accommodate my requests, whether it was about room preferences, local recommendations, or general inquiries.
The housekeeping staff deserves special appreciation as well. The room was consistently cleaned and maintained to a high standard. Every detail, from fresh linens to replenished amenities, was taken care of with care and consistency. Their quiet, respectful service added to the comfort of the stay.
I was also impressed by the restaurant and room service team, who were prompt, friendly, and attentive. They remembered preferences, offered helpful suggestions, and delivered everything with a smile. It's the kind of thoughtful service that truly enhances the overall guest experience.
What stood out the most was the genuine warmth and eagerness to help displayed by everyone — not just out of obligation, but seemingly because they truly cared about the guests' comfort and satisfaction. It’s rare to find such consistently positive and professional service across the board.
Overall, the staff played a major role in making my stay memorable. Their friendliness, attention to detail, and commitment to guest satisfaction were exemplary.

del068,del068_r3,mandeep singh,2,"I booked The Roseate in Aerocity, New Delhi, expecting a flawless luxury experience for the ₹10,000 a night price tag. What I got was… complicated.

The first room I was given had a stale, shut-in smell — like it had been locked for days. The chair’s fabric was torn, room service was slow, and worst of all, the door lock literally came loose in my hand (picture attached). For a hotel of this standard, that’s not just an inconvenience, it’s a security concern.

To their credit, the team responded by upgrading me to a gorgeous, much larger room — Bose 2.1 speakers, premium touches, the works. In that moment, I could see the luxury I was expecting all along.

But here’s my dilemma: should I have had to go through that first experience at all? When you pay premium rates, you expect every room to meet that standard from the start.

I didn’t try the restaurants on-site, so I can’t comment on the dining, and maybe that’s what could have completely won me over. For now, I’m left undecided — part of me wants to return, part of me wonders if first impressions are too important to ignore.",2025-08-13T13:17:59.352582882Z,3 weeks ago

I stayed at this hotel for 2 days to celebrate a birthday, and unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worst experiences I’ve had.
Breakfast service was chaotic and extremely delayed. Despite being advertised as complimentary, it felt more like an afterthought. Once seated, we had to follow up 4–5 times just to get basic service — completely unacceptable.
The staff pretends to be polite, but it's clear they are unwilling to put in any genuine effort. Any small request feels like a burden to them.
At the time of booking, we were promised several amenities and services — but once the booking was confirmed, none of those promises were fulfilled. To make things worse, they offer no cancellation or refund policy, which feels like a trap for unsuspecting guests.
Most of the positive reviews seem paid or heavily biased — the reality is far from what’s shown or promised online.

It hardly takes 5 minutes from e-rickshaw to reach hotel from Paharganj side exit of NDLS station and 30 mins from New Delhi Metro side(Ajmeri gate exit)
On top of that food was also a plus point.

We had a bit delay with allotment of room but  they manages it well.
Supportive staff.
Location is bit in crowded market ,but once you are in room it doesn't matter what's happening outside. Rooms are good and quite.
Price was a bit high for my hourly stay for 6 hrs

The rooms and the service that come with that price is more than what you ask for. They have a roof top restaurant and the food is just awesome. The place is like 700m from NDLS. The street is so narrow though that you would be surprised to find that such a big hotel in that narrow street.

My room was a good size, spacious and quiet. The bed was super comfortable and clean linen appreciated.

However the shower room was dirty,  grouting or sealant around the corners on the floor , inside the shower room was worse like it hadn’t been cleaned throughly it looked grimey & not well maintained.
The cupboards looked old and didn’t align to close . The shower doors water stained not cleaned.

Some of the rooms were being renovated and the carpets in the corridor were left dirty with building materials and hotel guests had to walk through that because it wasn’t hoovered up even after the working day ended.

I was surprised to see that for breakfast there weren’t any fresh fruit juices available. Otherwise there was good a variety of breakfast options to choose from.

I did request for a breakfast takeaway as I had an early morning flight and the restaurant staff very kindly obliged and packed me some prantha’s. The front desk staff needed some convincing of this though even though I explained I had arranged it with the restaurant staff myself.

I enjoyed the food  in the restaurant Fifty9,  the staff at the hotel are overall helpful and polite. It’s a great location central to most restaurants and boutiques for shopping.

- **No Basic Amenities:** Towels and soap weren’t even provided unless explicitly requested. Housekeeping standards were nonexistent.

del088,del088_r1,ayushi pathania,1,"We recently stayed at this hotel and left with several concerns. First, there was no visible EV charging station on the premises, which made planning for electric vehicle travel inconvenient. We also encountered an issue with dining service: when we ordered from a nearby restaurant that offered higher quality food, we were refused cutlery, which seemed unnecessary and unhelpful.

During our stay, a friend of ours was questioned about our intentions for visitation. This added an uncomfortable and intrusive atmosphere that did not align with the service standards we expect from a hotel. The staff overall appeared rude and demotivated, which affected the tone of every interaction.

The wellness facilities did not meet expectations either—the pool was quite small and felt more like a fountain than a proper pool. Upon arrival, the check-in experience felt transactional, and as the payment process concluded, we perceived a decline in the level of respect shown to us as guests.

In short, the hotel did not live up to the hospitality standards we value. I hope management takes these concerns seriously and makes tangible improvements, especially in guest respect, staff morale, and basic amenities like EV charging and dining support.",2025-08-24T00:32:38.999992460Z,a week ago

Rajiv and his events team were flawless in execution — every function, from Haldi and Mehendi to the lively Cocktail night and the beautifully themed Varmala, ran perfectly without us having to worry about a thing.

Decoration: Anshika’s decoration was pure magic. She understood our vision and transformed each venue into something unique and beautiful. Every event had its own character, making the celebrations even more special.

Food: The food was nothing short of exceptional. Even months later, our friends and family still talk about how amazing it was. The menu truly catered to every taste and preference, and the quality remained consistent throughout all the events.

Venue & Facilities: One of our top requirements was having different venues for different events within the same property, and Tivoli delivered perfectly. Our destination wedding felt grand, well-organized, and yet so personal.

The hotel is in a busy area. Shoppers stop is right next to the hotel. Two other malls along with many food options are at 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel.

The staff gets 10 stars out of 5. Very friendly. Everyone working at this hotel goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

Rooms are spacious and clean. When there are conferences/events by local companies, and their employees stay here, they end up smoking in non-smoking rooms. I have heard fire alarms going off in the middle of the night.

The breakfast buffet is good, with verities of options. But it's the same exact food (with small variations in the name) every day, so if you are staying here for more than 3-4 days, you will get bored.

The only complaint I have with this hotel is the spa. They have a whole menu of various type of exotic massages such as Indian massage, Thai massage etc, but the only services available were Swedish and deep tissue massage. My massage therapist spent so much time on my legs, that she ran out of time. She literally only had time to do two vertical strokes (no massaging) on my back and arms so that it can be called a full body massage. A complete waste of money.

del090,del090_r4,Brahma Raina,4,"It’s difficult to spot this Radisson hotel as it’s located in the Saket Select Citywalk mall. Google Maps is generally accurate enough if you are driving to the property as we did.

Upon arrival, you realise that there’s NO dedicated parking per se but parking is provided for hotel guests within the Mall’s parking - you don’t need to pay anything extra. However, it’s advisable that you avail of the valet service as they will ensure that your vehicle is safely parked and that your FASTag is not scanned for parking payment.

That said, now let’s move to the actual property itself. The check-in was a tedious affair as the personnel manning the desk(s) were very curt and inconsiderate. Not even a smile. Fortunately, as a Premium member of the Radisson Rewards scheme, we were upgraded to a suite - Room # 414, which is spacious and well lit by natural light. The air conditioning is excellent and the amenities good. Unfortunately, the bathroom was not clean - the actual commode was dirty with water stains and so were the sanitary fittings - all of them. Worse, water would very quickly fill up in the shower cubicle; an obvious result of a partly clogged drain.

The bed was comfortable and mattress adequately firm without sagging under the weight. Pillows were also comfortable. Room service was prompt.

As far as my wife and I are concerned, the hotel’s biggest selling point is that it’s slap bang within the Mall and you can walk from the reception directly into the Select Citywalk mall.

Unfortunately, the included buffet breakfast left a lot to be desired. There was limited option especially in the cold meat section and worse, the refilling of dishes took inordinately long.

The valet service was efficient and our vehicle was promptly brought to the entrance even though we came in and out at odd hours.

All in all, a good property. I can only hope that they have that bathroom issue sorted out.

Absolute Disappointment!!!!!!!

Staying at Ramada by Wyndham New Delhi Pitampura was an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Here’s what went wrong:

Staff attitude was appallingly arrogant:** The team behaved like the hotel was their personal property, treating guests with nothing short of disdain.
Overbearing scrutiny at every turn:** Every time we stepped in or out, we were bombarded with questions and made to feel like a crime was being committed—completely unnecessary and invasive.
Rooms and basic amenities:** The rooms were deeply unsatisfactory. The shower was unreliable and, to make matters worse, there were no towels available in the washroom when needed.
Privacy and hygiene concerns:** Housekeeping reportedly entered the room without consent, which felt intrusive and unsettling.
Reception leadership:** The on-site managers came across as surveillance-oriented, more focused on watching guests than delivering any kind of service.
Value for money:** In short, this stay felt like a poor use of money you’ve worked hard to earn. There are better options in Delhi that actually respect guests and provide decent hospitality.

If you’re researching this hotel, be aware that the treatment and conditions described above are not conducive to a comfortable or pleasant stay. Consider alternatives that prioritize guest comfort and respectful service.",2025-08-26T15:44:56.826234630Z,a week ago

My experience at Ramada by Wyndham New Delhi Pitampura was far from acceptable. Here’s how it went down:

Arrogant staff behaviour: The team acted like the hotel belonged to them personally, as if we were intruding into their private domain. The hospitality felt non-existent and distant, not the level you expect from a supposedly reputable hotel.

Overbearing approach at every turn: Every entry and exit from the room was met with interrogative questioning and unnecessary scrutiny, as if we were entering a “fun arena” rather than a comfortable hotel space.
Rooms and amenities: The rooms were pathetic. The shower never worked properly, and there were no towels kept in the washroom when needed.

Hygiene and housekeeping issues: The house cleaning staff allegedly entered the room without consent, which felt creepy and invasive. Privacy and safety concerns were at an all-time low.

Reception management: The so-called managers at the reception behaved like CCTV cameras watching your every move and had zero sense of hospitality. Their attitude was one of surveillance rather than service.

Overall value: Don’t waste your hard-earned money on this place. The experience was frustrating, discomforting, and far below any reasonable standard of hospitality.

Breakfast ok choice, uninterested staff do not respond well - omelette did not come even after waiting 30 mins, when there was no crowd and when asked when it will come the staff member ignored me.

Outdated tv.

del094,del094_r1,Rinku Khan,5,"Among all the hotels we’ve stayed in as Accor Plus Platinum members, Pullman New Delhi Aerocity truly stands out as something exceptional. From the moment we arrived, it felt like home.

The air conditioning was just right, the room spacious and immaculately clean, and the bed incredibly comfortable. But what truly made our stay special was the warmth and kindness of the staff.

A heartfelt thank you to Parul Malhotra and Nidhi , saying “thank you” doesn’t feel enough. The way you both cared for us with such grace and generosity left a lasting impression. We are truly grateful.

Special thanks to Rahul from housekeeping. He took care of every small detail in our room, always checking in to ensure we were comfortable and never needed anything. His dedication did not go unnoticed.

And then there’s “Nimri” , a name that now holds a special place in our hearts. Her thoughtfulness and care were beyond words. On the day we had to visit the hospital early morning without breakfast, she made sure we had a packed meal ready for after our appointment. That small but deeply kind gesture meant a lot to us. Nimri, you truly won our hearts.

A special mention must go to Minarwa, whom I believe is the restaurant manager. From breakfast to dinner, she ensured that every meal was perfect for us. Her constant attention, patience, and effort to provide us with the best food , always without hesitation , made our dining experience exceptional. We felt so well taken care of, and it made every mealtime a delight.

Lastly, the buffet deserves all the praise – without question, the best we’ve experienced. Every dish was full of flavor, carefully prepared, and absolutely delicious. Not a single item fell short, my wife especially loved every bit of it.

To everyone at Pullman New Delhi Aerocity  thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our stay not just comfortable, but truly unforgettable.

However, I noticed other reception staff casually chit-chatting, cracking jokes, and laughing loudly — which didn’t exactly set the right tone for a five-star property.

The real disappointment came at checkout. I was in a hurry to leave for a meeting and went to settle my bill. The taller gentleman at the reception had an expression as if I were staying for free and he was paying from his own pocket. He bluntly told me, “We first need to get your room checked before you can check out.” While I understand this is standard hotel procedure, most good hotels handle it discreetly without telling the guest directly in such a curt manner. His demeanor lacked basic courtesy — no “thank you” or “hope you enjoyed your stay,” just a dismissive “You’re done, you can go.”

It’s a shame because the hotel itself is decent, though dated. Expect older-style furniture, carpets, and interiors. On the plus side, the location is quite good. Unfortunately, the poor attitude of certain front desk staff overshadowed the positives.

It is positioned conveniently beside Janakpuri West Metro Station, and excellent connectivity is provided via the Blue and Magenta metro lines. The location is often regarded as ideal for both business and leisure travelers.

A modern design is featured by the hotel, and spacious rooms are offered. A well-maintained breakfast area is provided, and courteous service is generally delivered by the staff. The property's accessibility and the variety of local markets nearby are often appreciated by guests.

However, several issues have been reported. Cleanliness has been questioned frequently, and maintenance concerns have been raised—dusty curtains, malfunctioning air conditioning, and mold in bathrooms have been noted in many reviews. The building was previously operated as Piccadilly Hotel, and signs of aging have still been observed despite its rebranding under the Hyatt name.

Delays in check-in and room preparation have been experienced. Although the breakfast spread is praised and politeness is shown by the staff, disappointment has been expressed by many regarding overall service quality.

Overall setup and ambience - the view from the table was good but it was hot and humid despite the water cooler though we were not expecting AC like experience but it wasn't very comfortable, the decorations was kind gaudy though young couples may like it, but the worst part was privacy, hotel guests hotel staff were kept on walking by the table and some guests kept on staring at us as if we are jail convicts... So if you are going for privacy and good ambience this isn't the place/setup.

Service - service provided was good the fellow who served us I.e. Adarsh tried his best to keep us comfortable and provided us couple of things which were not part of the menu.

Food - chaat, golgappa, were good, so was the paneer tikka though dahi kebab weren't great, coming to main course all the Indian breads were good though the daal tadka could have been better, lastly the sweet dish I.e. Gulab jamun and rasmalai were below average in terms of taste and perhaps the only saving grace was the vanilla ice cream.

Bottomline - it's not worth the price and hassle and ecxcept for the staff who were very courteous there are so many things which need to be worked upon before it could be considered as something worth spending",2025-08-23T07:20:44.997534435Z,a week ago

del099,del099_r5,Aditya Menaria,2,"Ah, The Umrao—a four-star hotel experience with all the charm of a suspicious neighborhood guesthouse.

I stayed here with my brother and had an early morning flight, while he was heading back to the hotel afterward to get ready for work (since he lives in Delhi). We informed the receptionist very clearly that he wasn’t checking out. But apparently, “communication” is just decorative at this hotel.

While waiting for the valet, the receptionist decided to bless us with his presence—five times—to ask us to pay for a chocolate from the minibar. Yes, a chocolate. The room was fully paid for, mind you. But he looked at our bags and confidently concluded that we were sneaking away into the sunrise with unpaid chocolate bar. I tried to stay polite, because arguing over a chocolate at 6am isn’t exactly how I like to start my day, but honestly, if I couldn’t afford a snack from the minibar, I wouldn’t be staying at The Umrao. Wild concept, I know.

And just when we thought the morning couldn’t get any better, my brother’s car wouldn’t start. Turns out, the valet—clearly a seasoned professional of “25 years”—forgot to switch off the headlights. When confronted, he assured us with full confidence that he would never do something so silly. Thankfully, the CCTV footage didn’t get the memo—because it clearly showed the lights were on all night. Oops. Eventually, my brother and the valet had to push the car while I sat in the driver’s seat to jumpstart it. Just the kind of five-star valet service you dream about.

To their credit, one of the managers at checkout did try to smooth things over and was genuinely polite and professional. It’s just a shame that the rest of the experience made it feel like we were on some sort of hidden camera show.

Would I stay again? Probably not. Unless I’m in the mood to be accused of chocolate theft and stranded by valet expertise.",2025-05-01T13:27:01.187050Z,4 months ago

From the moment we arrived, the staff were great—very friendly and helpful. On entry, there's a security process with metal detectors and bag scanners, which I actually appreciated. It gave a sense of safety and reassurance, so no complaints there.

The hotel itself is lovely. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a great view. The location is perfect—within walking distance to everything, and it's directly connected to a shopping centre, which was really convenient.

The swimming pool was a highlight: warm, clean, and well-maintained.

If I had to make one small criticism, it would be about the buffet in the evening. While I understand we’re in India and local flavours are expected, I would’ve liked a bit more variety and perhaps some milder, cooler options considering it’s part of an international hotel chain.

However, the rooms fall short of expectations considering the price point. Many fixtures and furnishings appear dated, and some amenities show signs of wear and tear. The washroom fittings, especially the taps and shower system, are quite old and could benefit from modernization. Notably, the absence of a hand shower makes it inconvenient for guests who prefer a quick refresh without using the overhead shower.

del107,del107_r5,Prerna Wadhera,1,"Absolutely unacceptable experience – safety hazard, negligence, and disgraceful handling

We traveled all the way from London and were looking forward to a peaceful, comfortable stay at Aloft New Delhi—but what we experienced was nothing short of a nightmare.

A poorly secured cabinet in our room collapsed onto my foot, causing significant pain and swelling. The fact that such a serious safety hazard exists in a Marriott-branded property is shocking—but what followed was even more appalling.

We immediately contacted the hotel’s emergency line, expecting at least basic support. No one showed up. No first aid. No check-in. Not even a phone call. There was zero concern until we raised the issue again the next morning.

When I personally addressed this with the hotel manager, I was met with rudeness, apathy, and complete dismissal. He casually said, “these things happen,” and told me to just check out. No apology. No concern for my wellbeing. No accountability. Just indifference.

To make matters worse, the hotel’s idea of “resolution” was to refund 25% of the room charge—as if that makes up for the pain, the distress, and the humiliation of being treated like an inconvenience. It was insulting.

This wasn’t just poor service—it was gross negligence and deeply unprofessional conduct. Safety in a hotel room is non-negotiable. The complete lack of empathy and urgency shown by the staff reflects extremely poorly on Marriott’s standards.

We came all the way from another country and were treated with complete disregard during a painful and frightening incident.

I urge Marriott International to take this seriously and investigate this matter immediately. This is not how a global hospitality brand should operate.

But nowadays anything works: no telephone, TV nor bidet... And, still you are paying the extra. No toiletries, holey blankets, cockroaches, dust and stains everywhere. Looks like a 1 or 2 star hotel, definitelly not deserving of the 4 stars...

We had a terrible experience with the hotel workers: We had arguments trying to access the early check in upon arrival (which was already paid by us and confirmed by them). Also the first day they refused to serve us breakfast until we heavily complained (which we paid as well in advanced)... We arrived at 9am after a full night travelling with no sleep at all, and had to argue with more than 3 people, who were denying us the access to something that was paid for by us and confirmed by them via Booking chat and Whatsapp. Extremelly unconvinient and distastefull, even though we finally made it.

But when after an hour waiting while there were 3 workers ""working"" in the hall (one of them sleeping, one of them on the phone...), we got to room and it was definitely not ready: no towels, no bed linen in the bed... We had to complain several times in order to get those basic items and being able
to shower and sleep (and still they brought them one by one).

On top of that, yesterday we had issues again because we reconfirmed at the reception desk that we ordered breakfast for that morning (also paid for it with our reservation!!!), and they refused to serve it to us... until we complained again. Every complain means going up un down to the ground floor because the telephone is not working (neither does the hot water, etc...). When yesterday we finally recived the breakfast it was the wrong order and we need to waste another hour waiting. We had things to do, and we had no time to waste demanding something basic that we had paid for and reconfirmed via Booking chat, whatsapp and in person!!!

Also they tried to force us into writing a good review before even reciving the room. This makes a terrible experience for the foreign guest, we have been in plenty of hotels around India and Delhi and have never been treated this poorly.
At this point we even considered asking for the money back and leaving to another hotel (but we know they weren't likely to comply with refunding anything).",2025-08-28T21:06:38.144104081Z,a week ago

The area that the hostel was in is not a particularly pleasant area. Whilst it is conveniently very close to New Delhi station, this convenience is not worth it for the surrounding area. I would recommend choosing a hostel in more southern areas of the city.

The staff were calm, kind, and very professional—always ready to help with a smile, which made our stay even better.

Our room was cleaned every day, and the housekeeping team did a fantastic job maintaining hygiene and tidiness. Whenever we called the front office or kitchen, they responded promptly and politely.

Special mention to the buttermilk—it was so refreshing, I think I had more than four glasses a day! The on-site cafeteria and workspace with Wi-Fi was super convenient, especially for those looking to work or chill out. The open-to-sky terrace is a beautiful spot to relax, and they even host live music sometimes, which adds to the vibe.

del112,del112_r4,Julia Kozera,5,"Very okay hotel. It is in an old building, which has its pros and cons.

Overall pros:
- good value for money
- away from the hustle and bustle of the street
- the room was spacious, with a high ceiling
- even in the hottest weather (current temp. in New Delhi is 42*C) it heats up much less than in other hotels
- the water in the bathroom also remains pleasantly cool
- large, comfortable bed
- we were lucky that our room had a window and was bright
- quiet fan
- towels, they are not snow-white, but they are clean and stay fresh for a long time (usually after 3..4 uses hotel towels start to smell bad - these do not)
- access to drinking water
- large and pleasant lobby
- there is an elevator
- good Wi-Fi
- spacious terrace with a view, where you can also dry your laundry
- ZERO bugs

- the staff is very friendly, kind and discreet (both at the reception and the gentlemen taking care of cleanliness) 🙂
- I also think that they are friendly to LGBTQ+ people 🏳️‍🌈

Cons
- the room and bathroom are a bit worn out, but it doesn't affect functionality
- the floor in the bathroom and room, sink, mirror, countertops of cabinets and tables are also a bit dirty and neglected; they are rather dusted than washed (acceptable for me, but it may bother someone else)
- it happens there is water shortage from time to time, but it doesn't last long
- when we were checking out, some gentleman (maybe a superior) who appeared from time to time at the reception, stopped us trying to arrange the payment. This caused us to be seriously late for the bus. He could have done it so many times before when he saw us. He could also have been overseeing the formalities as they happened.

If someone after visiting this hotel is going to point out the paint peeling off the wall or a small hole in the sheet, they should better go straight to a 5-star hotel and not ruin the rating here.

Generally, we booked 2 nights and ended up staying for 9.
I highly recommend this hotel, as long as your expectations aren't too high.

""I stayed at Hotel Prince Palace Greens for a couple of nights, and my experience was just average. The room was clean, but the amenities were basic. The staff was friendly, but the service was slow at times.

The biggest letdown was the lack of attention to detail. The room didn't have drinking water, and the towels were not provided until I asked for them.

The location was also not ideal, with a lot of noise and chaos outside. However, the hotel's affordability was a plus point.

Overall, Hotel Prince Palace Greens is an average hotel that gets the job done. However, if you're looking for a more comfortable and hassle-free stay, you might want to consider other options.""",2025-02-01T02:47:27.180212Z,7 months ago

The room was dirty and stinking, with a bathroom that was filthy and clearly not cleaned properly. On top of that, they created a scene when I ordered food from a delivery app, which is completely unacceptable.

There’s absolutely no difference between the “delux rooms” they try to upsell,  it’s just a bluff to make you pay more. Not to mention, the hotel isn’t conveniently accessible from the airport as claimed.

del115,del115_r1,Настя Я,1,"❌ Scam, unsanitary conditions, and fake reviews – do not recommend!

If you ended up here reading this review, it means you’re one of the victims of this hotel.

Don’t be afraid to involve the police and report their scam if you get caught in their well-planned scheme. The police will help resolve the issue. That’s how we eventually managed to make them pay for the airport transfer they initially promised but refused to provide.

We booked this hotel through Booking.com at a certain price, but upon arrival, they charged us double. We had no choice but to pay, as we arrived late with our luggage, and the staff clearly took advantage of that. This was blatant deception.

The listing stated that airport transfer was included, but that was also a lie – no transfer was provided, and they just said “no.”

The room was absolutely not worth the money. The bedsheets were dirty, and the kitchen was in disgusting condition: dishes were stored on the floor, and dirty plates were left unwashed. After one of the breakfasts, I had stomach pain, and only later did I see the awful state of the kitchen – I wish I had seen it earlier.

The worst part is that we realized many of the reviews on Booking.com are clearly fake – overly generic and not written by real guests. The photos are also misleading – the actual conditions are much worse.

They clearly take advantage of the fact that travelers are often rushing to the airport and don’t have time to argue, so they run their business dishonestly and unethically. I strongly do not recommend staying here!

The hotel cancels or removes bookings of actual guests from Booking.com in order to prevent them from leaving honest reviews, leaving only fake positive comments. This is a dishonest practice and a clear attempt to mislead future travelers.",2025-07-07T07:26:12.299451483Z,2 months ago

I spoke directly to the hotel receptionist a couple of times to confirm the late check in. No extra cost was discussed. On my arrival, once the payment had been made the receptionist then increased the price by ₹1000. Knowing that I am a foreign solo lady traveller who had just arrived there at 1am therefore it's difficult to change hotels. I was forced to accept a refund of ₹650 and pay the new amount of ₹1000(he was asking for ₹1500) to a different account that I had just transferred to. With the change of account I think it must have been his personal account? It states on the facilities list that a free airport shuttle service is available yet when you ask to arrange this they are asking for ₹800.

However, instead of navigating the often chaotic public transport, it’s best to use Uber, which is affordable and more convenient.

The breakfast was excellent—fresh, satisfying, and a great start to the day.

While the rooms are generally clean and well-kept, they could use more attention to detail when it comes to deep cleaning and maintenance. Minor issues like mirror not being fully cleaned, or missed spots in cleaning can take away from an otherwise comfortable experience.

One important consideration is the surrounding area, which, like many parts of Delhi, can feel dirty and overwhelming, especially if you’re walking alone. Expect to encounter persistent beggars—keep your hands in your pockets and avoid stopping when approached.

del120,del120_r1,ERIC N,4,"I chose this hotel because it was in a convenient area for my stay and it was one of the most popular Treebo Hotels in Delhi.
It's a 7-8 minute walk from the metro station - Karol Bagh, which is
acceptable but not that close.
I arrived late at night, the receptionist and other staff were very friendly. However, unfortunately, the bed sheets and pillowcases were not so clean, so I asked for them to be changed.
They provided toilet paper and slippers.
The street in front of the hotel is very busy during the day and has a
very ethnic atmosphere.

Good points:
- All the staff are very friendly and helpful. If there was a problem,
they tried to deal with it right away.
- They provide water, which is helpful.
- A/C works.
- There is a refrigerator in the room.
- Breakfast is simple but acceptable.
- There is a water heater, so hot water is available.

Points that need improvement:
- It was described as a new hotel, but it didn't look like that.
- The room was very small.
- The bed was dented and not flat.
- It was noisy because you could hear the sounds from the hallway, other rooms, and outdoors.
- No water came out of the shower head.
- Water splashed all over the place from the bathroom faucet.
- The TV remote control didn't work, and although the staff came to check it out several times, they couldn't replace the batteries and the problem was not solved.

The staff were all very nice, so I would like to come back, but
considering the location and facilities, I feel the price is high. Is that the price  in Delhi?

Had a horrible stay, Hotel Sunstar Residency staffs had maneuver the act to misbehave with guest so that they never come back to this hotel.

We had spoke to Mr. Nitin previously and wanted for corporate booking for entire year, min 50, maximum  100 rooms, previously the room were not available. However, this was the first an last stay.

We have communicated with Nitin for the room confirmation on 27-Jun for our Owners and his guests.
The room was already prepaid immediately, even before checking.
First Day incident;
Our guests had ordered food..which was served without cutleries and plates. On requesting for plates, the waiter had the audacity to show his temper and advice our guest, that they should have thought and told about the basic amenities as he will have to go again to fetch the cutleries and plates..
Are the guests are expected to eat straight from serving bowl with hands. Even some road side dhabba are far better than this epitome of service standards.

This is sheer nuisance, where waiter and staffs are trained to misbehave with customer and one must stay away from this hotel, if you dont want to spoil your innner peace.
Second day incident;
Second incident happened, prior to this, even before checking, when payment for room, guest express chech in ids were all provided prior from the company, so that the Guest are not disturbed.
While checking out, the person sitting at reception had a insane behaviour of speaking to Guest as if they are thieves or criminals.
The reception staff threatened to pay a mere food bill amount of 378 rs, and Guests were made to stay back like criminals.
Third incident happened the same day:Guest has taken RO water, However, the staff at the reception insisted that mineral water was only sent, even if  they have consumed RO water they have to pay the price for mineral water.
They have made the guest wait and sent the staff to confirm the water bottles in the room.
This is beyond human tolerance and is sheer nuisance.

We have paid the room rent with breakfast yet haven't opted for breakfast  as they have misinformed the guest, the breakfast was not included, with this misbehaviour,
we will take appropriate escalation. This type of cheap behaviour is even not done in road side hotels. will intimate and reach out over digital platform,So, that everybody can be aware of such filthy behaviour of this Sunstar hotel staffs.

Even a 200 Rs lodge where I stayed once was better. Door and bathroom locks were faulty, Ac did not have any temperature control or remote and it would not work if there's a power cut, and interestingly, it was for more than 4 hrs during our stay. Seemed like they knowingly switched off ACs from somewhere and pretended the power cut  (I am not sure though). TV was not good, it was super small + sound would not reach to you on bed even when volume is full, and believe me room was not too big for that, just an eight feet distance between tv and your ears. Pillows were worst among all you have seen in your life. Even railways provide better pillows, these were no more than a rug thrown in garbage. Mattress was also torned. Despite saying multiple times we could get such rugs in the name of pillows only, they had no decent pillow in entire hotel. No water offered in the room, leave alone anything else. They provided a chargeable water bottle after asking many times. Even towels were not provided, they gave towels after asking multiple times. Toilet was dirty and I asked multiple times to have it cleaned, they kept ignoring it and was not cleaned till we checked-out. Food was just ok, but overpriced considering the quality and service, yet they charged a service charge which I denied to pay. They agreed. Staff behaviour was rude, an attendant almost scolded me as I complained to the manager that I am not getting the things done. Manager was trying cover up things, but that was of no use. Also, he made me cancel my online booking through Oyo to accept the amount shown on the app, otherwise he was asking more money than shown on app. Any good photos or reviews you see on net are either fake or may be from anytime in the history.

del137,del137_r3,Sonali Mishra,1,"**Disappointing Experience - Overcharged and Stay Reduced Without Reason**

I had a highly disappointing experience at this property. I originally booked through Booking.com for a specific amount and stay duration, but upon arrival, I was overcharged significantly (₹2,000 instead of the confirmed amount) without proper justification. To make matters worse, the hotel unilaterally reduced my stay by a day, again without any explanation.

This is completely unacceptable and feels like a deliberate scam. Despite showing the booking confirmation, the staff refused to honor the agreed terms. Communication with the hotel was unhelpful, and no effort was made to resolve the issue.

For anyone considering this property, I strongly advise against it unless you’re prepared for hidden charges and poor service. This experience not only ruined my trip but also made me question the trustworthiness of Booking.com for allowing such behavior from their partners.

I will be escalating this issue further with Booking.com and demanding proper action and compensation for this breach of trust.",2024-11-19T00:13:40.119212Z,9 months ago
del137,del137_r4,Scott Nguyen,1,"Hotel Vijaydeep Place near Delhi Airport is an absolute nightmare of a hotel, and I would strongly advise anyone to stay far away from it. My experience was nothing short of horrifying, starting from the moment I walked into the room. The photos and description in the booking were a complete misrepresentation. The room was dirty beyond belief, with no signs of cleaning having taken place before my arrival. The bed sheets were stained and clearly unchanged from previous guests, which is inexcusable for any hotel, let alone one located near a major international airport.

Things only got worse when there was a glass containing maggots in my room. This was not just a mistake—it was a serious health hazard, showing the complete lack of care for even the most basic hygiene. When I complained to the staff, they seemed indifferent and did nothing to address the issue, which left me feeling completely helpless and disgusted.

In addition to the appalling state of the hotel and its dangerous lack of hygiene, I discovered that the glowing reviews on Booking.com and Google Maps are likely fake. The reviews boast about clean rooms, great service, and a comfortable stay—none of which matched the reality I experienced. It’s clear the hotel is actively manipulating its online reputation to lure unsuspecting guests into a terrible experience.

The fact that the management appears to prioritize covering up their failings with fake reviews rather than addressing the numerous serious issues speaks volumes about the integrity of this place. No guest should ever have to deal with the level of filth, health risks, and dishonesty that I encountered.

This hotel is a scam from top to bottom, and I urge travelers to look elsewhere. With so many other options in the area, there’s no reason to subject yourself to this place. Save yourself the frustration, health risks, and disappointment, and avoid Hotel Vijaydeep Place at all costs.

I knew I would reach only around this time with my parents and my kid. Hence I had paid the full amount for the hotel while booking itself. So that we don't have to wait at the hotel, after a long flight and we had an international flight in the morning to catch.  Once we reached there he says you have to pay extra because room rent has increased in a day's time. I called oyo customer care (multiple times) and after an hour they said they have paid the extra amount which the hotel guy says they did not. Finally after all the drama I finally paid additional 600 from my pocket and got a room at the third floor of the hotel where there is no lift. Initially the hotel receptionist said the Oyo rooms have to pay the additional charge that is why I was waiting. With my kid already asleep on the couch and my old parents tired and irritated. I didn't want to go hunting for another hotel at that time in Delhi with so many luggages with us. The room was bare minimum of the expectation. After an hour of us waiting and then reaching the room, they were still cleaning the room or so it appeared. The breakfast in the morning was also no frills breakfast.

The location is definitely a big plus—right in the heart of Karol Bagh, close to the market and metro station, which made getting around quite convenient.

The staff was polite and tried to be helpful whenever we needed anything. The room was fairly clean and had basic amenities. It's a budget hotel, so don’t expect luxury, but it serves the purpose well if you're looking for something affordable and well-located.

A few things could be improved, like faster room service and better bathroom maintenance, but for the price, it’s reasonable. If you're traveling on a budget and want to stay close to shopping and food joints, this place is worth considering.""",2025-06-05T07:34:17.354290Z,3 months ago

del142,del142_r3,Vineet Mani,2,"I reached the hotel at around 1 a. m. with some difficulty as the location on Google Maps was inaccurate. The hotel is situated in a narrow alley. The entrance was a small one and the check-in did not take much time. I reached my room on third floor through elevator and the bell boy came along to drop me off.

I was famished, but the hotel had no kitchen and it was too late to get anything from outside. However, I got two water bottles with the help of the person  at the Reception, Shivam.

I booked the room via Agoda and the images were somewhat an eyewash as the room allotted was under-lit and it was somewhat compact. There was storage space, but no table or chair to sit and eat.

It rained heavily for a brief time period the next day and the duct passing from inside the room meant for fire safety had huge leakages and in fact, the water started dripping on television and on the floor considerably. Moreover, the toilet seat was too low to sit for a tall person like me. The cleanliness could have been much better and the management and manager must keep a strong tab on it.

I stayed for a day, and the experience was just average. The breakfast they brought in the morning was great and so was the tea, but I had to have it sitting on the bed and was jittery to think what if the white linen gets soiled. They should provide some table or atleast a stool to keep the eatables while eating.

The accessibility and reachability to the Railway Station was great. The management must improve the look and feel and shall increase the maintenance and cleanliness standards.

The air conditioning worked well, and the Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was important for my work.

The bathroom was spotless, and I appreciated the quality toiletries provided. However, the shower pressure could have been a bit stronger.

Hotel staff were friendly and attentive, and check-in/check-out was smooth. I also appreciated the quick room service in early morning Tea & Toast supplies in the room.

Charged extra ₹1,000 for early check-in at 8 AM, only to get a room with stained bedsheets, dirty quilt covers, stained pillows, and broken toilet flush. When complained, they changed bedsheets but new ones were also poor quality. Promised quilt cover replacement ""once laundry comes"" - took until 9 PM.

Multiple requests for basic amenities met with ""reception not available, will provide later"" excuses. Poor follow-through on service.

**Bottom line**: Why advertise what you can't provide and overcharge for subpar service? Think twice before booking. Only consider if you absolutely must stay in this area and have no other options. Don't expect good cleanliness or service standards.",2025-05-28T16:00:48.654658Z,3 months ago

My dad has a back condition, when asked for just 2 hours late checkout as our train was late, they asked for 2k more (amount for a whole day).",2025-07-20T04:23:55.616385664Z,a month ago

The owner is extremely rude and arrogant, with zero sense of customer service. This place survives only by cheating guests. Do yourself a favor—never book this hotel.

Worst Stay Ever – Hidden Charges, Bad Food & Greedy Management
Booked for ₹874/night, but the owner kept adding charges (₹400 extra for AC, etc.) until it became about ₹1,500/day. Food is terrible and outrageously priced — even a watery cup of tea costs ₹40. Owner later asked me to vacate just to get more money from the room. Extremely unprofessional experience.",2025-08-14T14:06:50.347786257Z,3 weeks ago

Also she charges fifty rupees for homemade chai which is equal to the consistency of water, better to have it outside from a local stall.",2025-04-24T14:34:43.629019Z,4 months ago

del150,del150_r2,Sandeep Singh,1,"My experience at this hotel was extremely disappointing and frustrating. After I made my booking, the staff demanded extra money, which was completely unfair and unprofessional.

The condition of the room was shockingly bad. The bathroom was a mess – there was no light, no tap, and it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages. On top of that, they didn’t even provide a room key. When I asked for one, they casually told me to leave the room unlocked and assured me that nothing would be stolen because they had cameras installed. This was extremely uncomfortable and unsafe.

The bed sheets were disgustingly dirty, and it felt unhygienic to even sit on the bed. The room phone was broken, and almost everything in the room seemed neglected and poorly maintained. The overall cleanliness of the room and bathroom was nonexistent, making it impossible to feel comfortable.

The service was equally terrible. The staff didn’t seem to care about customer experience at all and were very unprofessional in their approach.

I would strongly advise others to stay away from this hotel. It’s not worth the money, time, or peace of mind. If you value cleanliness, safety, and basic hospitality, avoid this place at all costs.
