They are truly exceptional and are a great example of Indian hospitality.\n\nHowever the rooms and the general lack of up keeping is what let's the hotel down. The lower floor rooms are very dated and in need to maintenance. During the course of 3 days stay we changed 3 rooms due to problems in room cleanliness, ac issue, etc. Biggest concern is that the rooms in 9th floor all have ac condensation issues and you end up with wet and sticky floors all the time. The other issue around general cleanliness and maintenance is obvious- rooms have mould, chipped wooden fixtures, rusted door frames, etc. Even the lifts are outdated with broken/ rusted panel board.\nWhile these issues can easily be ignored in a 3 star or even 4 star hotel, this is not acceptable in a hotel advertising themselves as a 5 star. Additionally I have never seen a 5 star hotel that don't provide amenities like hair dryer as part of standard bathroom fixtures or have concierge or travel assistance services.\n\nOverall my stay was made memorable only by the service of staff and I am not impressed by hotel amenities in any way.

The service was outstanding \u2014 the staff were highly professional and ensured our stay was both comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nOne unique and convenient feature of this hotel is the in-house liquor shop. Since liquor purchase in Gujarat requires a permit, the hotel assists guests by providing a letter which helps in obtaining a liquor permit easily. This makes it one of the few hassle-free options for buying liquor in Ahmedabad.\n\nOverall, highly recommended for both business and leisure stays!",

We were travelling with our two autistic sons, and it is very important for us to have interconnecting rooms, wherever possible, so we could ensure their comfort and safety. Initially, this posed a challenge, but Mr. Lohani went above and beyond to resolve the situation swiftly and with genuine care.\n\nThanks to his efforts, we were able to relax and fully enjoy our time at this beautiful hotel, knowing that our boys were safe and close by. It is rare to come across staff who not only provide excellent service but also show such professionalism, understanding and compassion, and for that, we are truly grateful.\n\nThe Hillock Hotel is a wonderful place to stay, but it is the people who make it truly memorable.

They have hostel rules, any guest is not allowed to go in room after 7 PM. This was bit of a bummer.\n3. They switch off the AC if you sit too long in the cafe/lounge.\n\nI must admit some good folks too work here but overall a very disappointing and pathetic experience.",

Right from the moment I walked into the hotel, I was impressed by the elegant design, warm hospitality, and attention to detail that made my experience truly memorable.\nThe rooms were incredibly comfortable\u2014spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. The bed was super cozy, and the high-quality linens added to the overall luxury. I really appreciated the quietness of the room, which made it easy to relax and unwind after a long day.\nThe hotel had everything I needed. The gym was well-equipped, and the spa was the perfect place to de-stress. The swimming pool area was serene and well-maintained, offering a great spot to just relax. I also loved how eco-friendly the hotel is, which is a nice touch without compromising on comfort.\nThe dining experience was one of the highlights. The variety of food, from local Gujarati dishes to international cuisines, was impressive. Every meal I had was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The breakfast buffet especially stood out with its wide selection\u2014I found myself looking forward to it every morning!\nThe staff at ITC Narmada were incredibly courteous and attentive. They made sure I felt welcomed and taken care of throughout my stay. Whether it was room service, front desk assistance, or the restaurant staff, everyone was professional.\nThe hotel\u2019s location is perfect\u2014right in the heart of Ahmedabad, making it easy to explore the city. Despite being centrally located, the hotel felt like a peaceful retreat. The architecture and interior design beautifully reflect the local culture, giving the whole place a warm and luxurious vibe.\nITC Narmada exceeded my expectations in every way. From comfort and luxury to amazing food and top-notch service, it was an incredible experience. I\u2019d definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Ahmedabad, whether for business or leisure.",

As a frequent traveler who values both comfort and quality service, this stay exceeded all my expectations.\n\nFrom the moment I checked in, I was greeted warmly by the courteous front desk staff, who ensured a smooth and quick check-in process. The room I was provided was spotless, well-appointed, and incredibly comfortable. Everything \u2014 from the bedding to the amenities \u2014 reflected the high standards of the Marriott brand. The housekeeping team maintained cleanliness impeccably throughout my stay, and that truly added to the overall comfort.\n\nHowever, what truly made this visit exceptional was the restaurant service and culinary experience. The food at the in-house restaurant was nothing short of phenomenal. I want to especially recognize Chef Sunil Kumar, who is undoubtedly one of the best chefs I\u2019ve come across in all my travels. Every dish he prepared was cooked to perfection \u2014 flavorful, fresh, and beautifully presented. His attention to detail and commitment to authentic taste made each meal a memorable one. Whether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I found myself looking forward to the next meal with excitement.\n\nA special mention also goes to Anil, who provided exceptional customer service during my time at the restaurant. His professionalism, warm demeanor, and prompt attention to every need created a welcoming dining environment. His genuine hospitality made me feel truly valued as a guest.\n\nOverall, this property offers everything a traveler could hope for \u2014 cleanliness, comfort, superb food, and top-tier hospitality. I left with a sense of satisfaction and gratitude, and I will most definitely return on my future trips to Ahmedabad.\n\nFive stars well-deserved. Highly recommended!",

As a frequent traveler who values both comfort and quality service, this stay exceeded all my expectations.\n\nFrom the moment I checked in, I was greeted warmly by the courteous front desk staff, who ensured a smooth and quick check-in process. The room I was provided was spotless, well-appointed, and incredibly comfortable. Everything \u2014 from the bedding to the amenities \u2014 reflected the high standards of the Marriott brand. The housekeeping team maintained cleanliness impeccably throughout my stay, and that truly added to the overall comfort.\n\nHowever, what truly made this visit exceptional was the restaurant service and culinary experience. The food at the in-house restaurant was nothing short of phenomenal. I want to especially recognize Chef Sunil Kumar, who is undoubtedly one of the best chefs I\u2019ve come across in all my travels. Every dish he prepared was cooked to perfection \u2014 flavorful, fresh, and beautifully presented. His attention to detail and commitment to authentic taste made each meal a memorable one. Whether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I found myself looking forward to the next meal with excitement.\n\nA special mention also goes to Anil, who provided exceptional customer service during my time at the restaurant. His professionalism, warm demeanor, and prompt attention to every need created a welcoming dining environment. His genuine hospitality made me feel truly valued as a guest.\n\nOverall, this property offers everything a traveler could hope for \u2014 cleanliness, comfort, superb food, and top-tier hospitality. I left with a sense of satisfaction and gratitude, and I will most definitely return on my future trips to Ahmedabad.\n\nFive stars well-deserved. Highly recommended!",

The bed was plush and incredibly comfortable, ensuring restful nights during my stay. The room was equipped with all essential amenities, including a flat-screen TV, a well-stocked minibar, a safe, and complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi, which catered well to both relaxation and work needs.\n\nOne of the highlights was the luxurious bathroom, complete with a rain shower and high-quality toiletries. The housekeeping staff maintained the room impeccably, attending to every detail to ensure cleanliness and comfort.\n\nDining at Pride Plaza was an absolute delight. The breakfast buffet offered a wide array of options, from traditional Indian dishes to continental favorites, beautifully presented and delicious.

I particularly enjoyed a rejuvenating spa treatment that was a perfect way to unwind after a busy day.\n\nWhile my experience was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few areas for potential enhancement. The air conditioning unit in my room was slightly noisy at times, which might be bothersome to light sleepers. Also, while the Wi-Fi service was generally strong, it could occasionally be intermittent, which might need slight improvement for those reliant on constant connectivity.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Pride Plaza Hotel was delightful, marked by excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and convenient location. I felt truly valued as a guest due to the attentive and friendly staff who were always eager to assist. I highly recommend Pride Plaza Hotel to anyone visiting the area, be it for business or leisure.\n\nI look forward to returning to Pride Plaza in the future and experiencing the high standard of hospitality once again.

The availability of transportation arranged swiftly by the concierge added to the convenience, enhancing the overall stay experience.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel offered a range of leisure facilities, including a well-equipped fitness center and a relaxing spa. I particularly enjoyed a rejuvenating spa treatment that was a perfect way to unwind after a busy day.\n\nWhile my experience was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few areas for potential enhancement. The air conditioning unit in my room was slightly noisy at times, which might be bothersome to light sleepers. Also, while the Wi-Fi service was generally strong, it could occasionally be intermittent, which might need slight improvement for those reliant on constant connectivity.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Pride Plaza Hotel was delightful, marked by excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and convenient location. I felt truly valued as a guest due to the attentive and friendly staff who were always eager to assist. I highly recommend Pride Plaza Hotel to anyone visiting the area, be it for business or leisure.\n\nI look forward to returning to Pride Plaza in the future and experiencing the high standard of hospitality once again. Thank you for making my stay so pleasant and memorable.",

The warm and welcoming staff greeted me with genuine smiles, setting the tone for what would be a truly delightful stay. The check-in process was seamless, and the front desk staff was efficient in providing me with all the necessary information about the hotel's facilities and amenities.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay at Hyatt Ahmedabad was undoubtedly the culinary experience. The hotel offers a range of dining options, each serving delectable dishes prepared with finesse. The breakfast buffet at the in-house restaurant was a culinary journey in itself. It offered an extensive spread of both Indian and international cuisines, catering to diverse palates. The quality of the food was outstanding, and the attentive waitstaff ensured that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. Additionally, the hotel's on-site caf\u00e9 provided a cozy ambiance, making it the perfect spot to unwind over a cup of freshly brewed coffee and delectable pastries.\n\nDuring my stay, I had the opportunity to attend a corporate event at Hyatt Ahmedabad. The hotel boasts state-of-the-art meeting rooms and event spaces that are equipped with modern amenities. The event coordination team displayed efficiency and professionalism, ensuring that every aspect of the gathering was flawlessly executed. The seamless corporate event experience, combined with the hotel's commitment to providing top-notch facilities, makes it an ideal choice for business travelers.\n\nThe rooms at Hyatt Ahmedabad were an epitome of comfort and elegance. The contemporary interiors were tastefully designed with attention to detail. The king-sized bed with plush linens provided a restful night's sleep, and the spacious work desk offered a functional space for catching up on work. The room also featured modern amenities such as a flat-screen TV, a minibar, and complimentary Wi-Fi, ensuring a comfortable and convenient stay.\n\nCleanliness is a hallmark of Hyatt Ahmedabad. The housekeeping staff did an impeccable job in maintaining the rooms and the entire hotel premises. The pristine condition of the room was a testament to their dedication to ensuring a hygienic and comfortable environment for guests.\n\nIn addition to its exceptional staff and amenities, Hyatt Ahmedabad offers a variety of thoughtful amenities that cater to the needs of its guests. The fitness center, equipped with modern workout equipment, was a boon for fitness enthusiasts like me who didn't want to compromise on their exercise routine while traveling. The rooftop swimming pool offered a refreshing escape from the city's hustle and bustle, providing stunning views of Ahmedabad's skyline. The hotel's spa services allowed me to indulge in some well-deserved relaxation and rejuvenation after a day of exploration.\n\nHyatt Ahmedabad's location in the heart of the city was a significant advantage. It provided easy access to some of Ahmedabad's most prominent attractions, including the historic Sabarmati Ashram and the vibrant local markets. Whether I wanted to immerse myself in the city's rich history or explore its modern offerings, everything was just a short distance away from the hotel.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Hyatt Ahmedabad was truly remarkable. The combination of great staff, delicious food, excellent corporate event facilities, pristine rooms, and thoughtful amenities made for an unforgettable experience. Whether for business or leisure, Hyatt Ahmedabad offers a perfect blend of comfort and elegance that caters to the needs of every traveler.
