I never found it crowded.\nRoom service is exceptional\nI had rooms with BF but a bit disappointed with the taste and quantity. Breakfast was not as per my expectation and quantity was very less in dinner\nThey can also facilitate private 2 or 4 wheeler on your request at nominal charges. I saw somewhere Rs 499 per day for 2 wheeler\nConsidering all above reasons, i would like to stay at Laxmi Palace again and highly recommend to others",

The interval room is quite quite beautiful where they greet you with a drink. The area by the pool is relaxing also with three cabanas and the service friendly and lovely. The pool is a delightful space. Sunbeds facing the garden are best. The gym is modern and has a nice aspect in an air conditioned glazed balcony overlooking the pool. Our room, 118 was super large and comfortable. Housekeeping and laundry were impeccable quick and polite. Food at the restaurant was delicious - from the breakfast dhosas, bhurji to the evening tikka / tandoori chicken with delicious breads and jeers or veg rice and amazing vegetable dishes.\nService was impeccable through out. The courtyard was cool enough in August for us to eat outside in the evening but the restaurant room is glorious as is the winter bar next to it which is stunning. Casting around for an issue the only one I could find was that I went to get our bags on arrival as I wanted a swim and they took a while to arrive. In other words Samode Haveli is near perfect. We had a lovely stay in the Oberoi in Agra and were wondering if we should\u2019ve gone to them in Jaipur - Samode was by far the better choice with atmospheric and beautiful settings and top service. Loved it.",

The room was clean, well-maintained, and tastefully decorated, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The bed was large and very comfortable, with high-quality linens that made for a restful night's sleep. The bathroom was spotless and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. I appreciated the thoughtful touches like a coffee maker, mini-fridge, and complimentary bottled water.\n\nThe staff were friendly and professional, always ready to assist with any requests. Housekeeping did a great job each day, and the front desk was efficient during both check-in and check-out.\n\nOne minor downside was the limited soundproofing; I could occasionally hear noise from the hallway. Also, while the room had most modern amenities, a few extra USB charging ports would have been helpful.\n\nLocation-wise, the hotel is in a convenient area close to restaurants, shops, and public transportation. It made exploring the city very easy.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d highly recommend this hotel room to both business and leisure travelers. It offers great value for the price, and I would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to tailor this for a specific hotel or experience.",

            "text": "Hotel Arco Palace, Jaipur\n\nOverview:\nHotel Arco Palace is a standard hotel, easily accessible and located near Sindhi Camp. Here\u2019s a list of pros and cons based on my personal experience.\n\nPros:\n1. Location:\nPerfect location \u2014 barely 500 meters from Sindhi Camp Metro Station.\n\n1.Hawa Mahal \u2013 around 15 minutes\n\n2.Jal Mahal \u2013 around 25 minutes\n\n3.Amer Fort \u2013 around 40 minutes\n\n2. Reasonable Rates:\nThe rooms are fairly priced.\n\n3. Hotel Staff:\nThe staff is extremely prompt in their service and also really sweet and kind.\n\n4. Check-in & Check-out:\nWe arrived early at around 8:30 AM. After waiting for about 1.5 hours, we were allotted our room. Usually, hotels don\u2019t allow early check-in, but they did, which was really great and helpful.\n\n5. Room:\nThe room had proper ventilation, and the mattresses were of really good quality. Usually, hotel mattresses are way too hard, making sleep uncomfortable, but here we were able to sleep peacefully because of the good-quality mattress.\n\nCons:\n1. Surroundings:\nThe hotel is near the bus stop, so there\u2019s a lot of commotion. The area is congested.\n\n2. Limited Space:\nThe hotel is built as a standalone building.\n\n3.

            "text": "Hotel Arco Palace, Jaipur\n\nOverview:\nHotel Arco Palace is a standard hotel, easily accessible and located near Sindhi Camp. Here\u2019s a list of pros and cons based on my personal experience.\n\nPros:\n1. Location:\nPerfect location \u2014 barely 500 meters from Sindhi Camp Metro Station.\n\n1.Hawa Mahal \u2013 around 15 minutes\n\n2.Jal Mahal \u2013 around 25 minutes\n\n3.Amer Fort \u2013 around 40 minutes\n\n2. Reasonable Rates:\nThe rooms are fairly priced.\n\n3. Hotel Staff:\nThe staff is extremely prompt in their service and also really sweet and kind.\n\n4. Check-in & Check-out:\nWe arrived early at around 8:30 AM. After waiting for about 1.5 hours, we were allotted our room. Usually, hotels don\u2019t allow early check-in, but they did, which was really great and helpful.\n\n5. Room:\nThe room had proper ventilation, and the mattresses were of really good quality. Usually, hotel mattresses are way too hard, making sleep uncomfortable, but here we were able to sleep peacefully because of the good-quality mattress.\n\nCons:\n1. Surroundings:\nThe hotel is near the bus stop, so there\u2019s a lot of commotion. The area is congested.\n\n2. Limited Space:\nThe hotel is built as a standalone building.\n\n3. Rooms:\nThe rooms are big in size with proper ventilation, but the walls were withering. The room was cleaned only on the surface level \u2014 in-depth cleaning was not done. I even saw a cockroach.\nThere was no kettle in the room, so one couldn\u2019t prepare anything for themselves.\n\n4. Washroom:\nThis was the biggest disappointment for me.\n\nThe flush didn\u2019t have proper capacity.\n\nThe washroom was constructed in a way that water couldn\u2019t drain properly.\n\nThere was no separation between the seat and bathing area, which was awful.\n\nThe AC conduit pipe was attached in the washroom, so the washroom was constantly wet \u2014 making it very unpleasant.\n\nThe sink was also unclean.\n\nFinal Rating:\nI genuinely hope they work on these shortcomings.\n\nAll the very best to the hotel \u2014 and kudos to the staff for being extremely cooperative and trying to make the stay better.",

A special shoutout to the incredibly kind and accommodating staff\u2014when we craved pasta during the dinner buffet (even though it wasn\u2019t on the menu), they went the extra mile to have it freshly prepared by the chef just for us! That level of care and hospitality truly made us feel valued.\nWe did face a minor issue with the room AC, but the hotel manager handled it promptly and professionally by upgrading us to a better room\u2014turning a small hiccup into an even more memorable experience.\nThe ambience of the hotel is simply superb\u2014elegant, warm, and welcoming.

Everything they do is centered around making your experience exceptional. From their respectful and humble demeanor to their down-to-earth hospitality, they exceeded every expectation I had.\n\nWe booked six rooms at this beautiful Mahal, and while it doesn\u2019t boast the glitz and glamour of big-brand hotels, it far surpasses any 5-star property with its unmatched service.\n\nThe food? Simply incredible. We enjoyed breakfast and most of our dinners on the rooftop, where not only was the food delicious, but also reasonably priced. Dining under the stars with such flavorful dishes made every meal a memory.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Jaipur again, there\u2019s no question\u2014this is where I\u2019ll stay. Ajay, Mohan, and their exceptional team deserve all the praise.

Everything they do is centered around making your experience exceptional. From their respectful and humble demeanor to their down-to-earth hospitality, they exceeded every expectation I had.\n\nWe booked six rooms at this beautiful Mahal, and while it doesn\u2019t boast the glitz and glamour of big-brand hotels, it far surpasses any 5-star property with its unmatched service.\n\nThe food? Simply incredible. We enjoyed breakfast and most of our dinners on the rooftop, where not only was the food delicious, but also reasonably priced. Dining under the stars with such flavorful dishes made every meal a memory.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Jaipur again, there\u2019s no question\u2014this is where I\u2019ll stay. Ajay, Mohan, and their exceptional team deserve all the praise. They made us feel like royalty.\n\nMy only minor complaint was the early morning noise from the kitchen preparation, but to be fair, my room was on the ground floor, so it\u2019s understandable.\n\nStill, this place should be at the top of your list for a stay in Jaipur.

            "text": "I stayed at Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur for two nights during my visit to the Pink City. Here are my impressions of the hotel:\n\n## Location\n\nThe hotel is located in the city center, about 10 minutes' drive from Jaipur Airport and 15 minutes from Jaipur Junction railway station. It is also close to some of the main attractions of the city, such as Jal Mahal, City Palace, and Hawa Mahal. The hotel offers free parking, either underground or outdoors, and can arrange airport shuttles and day trips at the tour desk.\n\n## Rooms\n\nThe hotel has 108 non-smoking rooms, fitted with air conditioning, wooden flooring, a 40-inch LED TV, a minibar, a coffee/tea maker, a desk, a safe, slippers, a hair dryer, and bath products. The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable, with a sitting area and a city view. The hotel also has different types of suites and club rooms that offer additional amenities and services, such as fruit platters, complimentary minibar, snacks, discounts on F&B and spa, and access to the club lounge.\n\n## Facilities\n\nThe hotel has a rooftop outdoor pool that overlooks the Aravalli Hills, a gym, a spa, a business center, and ample event space. The pool is open from September to March and has a bar that serves Italian dishes and drinks. The gym is well-equipped and the spa offers various treatments and massages. The business center has computers, printers, and internet access. The event space can accommodate up to 500 guests for meetings, weddings, or parties.\n\n## Dining\n\nThe hotel has two restaurants and two bars. Sunflower is the main restaurant that serves a free buffet breakfast of Indian and continental dishes. It also offers lunch, dinner, and 24/7 room service. Liquid Ice is a cozy bar that serves continental and Indian cuisine, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. VUE is the rooftop bar that operates from September to March and offers Italian appetizers and entr\u00e9es. The club lounge is exclusive for club room guests and serves tea/coffee and snacks.\n\n## Service\n\nThe hotel staff are friendly, helpful, and professional. They provide 24-hour front desk service, concierge service, dry cleaning and laundry service, and daily housekeeping. They also assist with travel arrangements, luggage storage, currency exchange, car rental, and ticketing. They are attentive to the guests' needs and requests and make sure they have a pleasant stay.\n\n## Overall\n\nI enjoyed my stay at Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur. It is a modern, comfortable, and convenient hotel that offers good value for money. It has everything you need for a business or leisure trip to Jaipur. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the city's culture and history.",

From the moment we arrived, Divya at the front desk greeted us with warm hospitality and a beautiful traditional welcome. Lokendra, the manager, went above and beyond by upgrading our room and making arrangements for a lovely bouquet, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe hotel itself is stunning, with intricate architecture and luxurious amenities. Narendra from Housekeeping did an excellent job decorating our room, which added a personal touch to our stay. The staff, including Bishan, Brinda, and Subodh, were attentive to our every need, making sure that we had everything we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. One thing that really stood out was that they served water in glass bottles, which we really appreciated as it shows their commitment towards sustainability.\n\nThe highlight of our stay was definitely the birthday celebration for my husband. The hotel staff went above and beyond to make it a special occasion. They decorated our room with balloons and flowers, and surprised my husband with a delicious birthday cake cut with Talwar. We also enjoyed a romantic dinner at the hotel's restaurant, where the food was delicious and the service was impeccable, thanks to Bishan, Brinda, Ravindra and Subodh & special thanks to Anand who arranged cake in very short time.\n\nIn true spirit, the staff at Taj Hari Mahal follow the saying '\u0905\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f \u0926\u0947\u0935\u094b \u092d\u0935\u0903' (Atithi Devo Bhava) which means 'Guest is God.'

The bed was large and very comfortable, with high-quality linens that made for a restful night's sleep. The bathroom was spotless and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries.
