I always had to make sure that I didn't leave the light on there. The door to the bathroom also wasn't able to close fully, so they would also come into my sleeping room. But the worst thing in there was that at some daytime you could hear a bigger animal above the ceiling of the bathroom. I was always afraid a rat or something could crash in. However, I stayed because of budget reasons.\n\nThe next blow didn't wait for long. I felt a little bit sick after the first night with the aircon on. Didn't think much about it. But after the second night I was totally sick and needed to recover in that hotel room with no aircon since it obviously hadn't been cleaned and made people sick. I never had a problem with getting sick from an ac and have travelled over 9 months in tropical countries. The health issues clearly must have been from an uncleaned ac.\n\nAs soon as I was able to go, I followed Indian friends' advice and booked a reputable hotel. It was worth it.",

The rooms were beautifully maintained and offered the perfect balance of comfort and luxury.\n\nA special mention to Chef Patil ji, who greeted us every morning at breakfast with a warm smile and a spread of absolutely delicious food. His personal touch and attention to our preferences made every breakfast feel special and homely. It was such a delightful way to start the day!\n\nAnother big thank you to Pushpalata ji from the room service team, who took great care in keeping our room just the way we liked it. She was always polite, attentive, and ensured that every little detail was taken care of, which truly enhanced our comfort.\n\nWhat touched us the most was the way ITC Maratha made my husband's birthday extra special. We were pleasantly surprised with a beautifully arranged cake, a bouquet of fresh flowers, and a lovely fruit basket waiting in our room. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made the day truly memorable for both of us.\n\nThank you, ITC Maratha, for a stay filled with warmth, care, and thoughtful touches. We\u2019ll always remember this experience fondly and look forward to visiting again!",

We stayed for 7 days in a Luxury Queen category room, which was exceptionally spacious with a separate workstation that made our stay comfortable. The bathroom was nice, the staff was good and cooperative, and the terrace breakfast was a delightful experience. The overall atmosphere and weather were also enjoyable, making the stay truly comfortable and memorable.\n\nAugust 2025 Stay\n\nUnfortunately, our second stay in August 2025 was completely disappointing. The staff mistakenly kept my injections in a freezer instead of a refrigerator, which destroyed medicines worth about Rs. 35,000. Although the staff and manager apologized, no refund or compensation was offered for this serious negligence. The terrace breakfast was unpleasant due to the rainy weather, and the room allotted to us was much smaller than expected, even though we paid for the same Luxury Queen category. To make matters worse, the geyser was faulty \u2014 water from the shower was either scalding hot or ice cold, which made the stay very uncomfortable.\n\nThe lack of consistency in service and facilities, along with the handling of a costly mistake, turned what was once a pleasant experience into a highly disappointing one.",

            "text": "Beautiful Hotel at a lovely location. Enjoyed the weekend of Independence day.\nWe did the booking directly with Taj. They were so helpful from the start,, Rohit the Asst Manager took care of all our needs specially for my old parents who needed a room for specially abled.\nCheck in process was smooth and perfect. Jasmeet had contacted us before our check in and made lovely decorations for our celebration of 85th Birthday as well as for Anniversary. Jasmeet said she was our one point contact for all our needs but unfortunately after we checked in she hardly responded to our queries.\nWe had booked 4 rooms. We had 2 pool facing rooms as those are the only ones for the specially abled people and 2 Mangrove view rooms which have an excellent view. You must choose mangrove view. Prachi did a very smooth check in for all our rooms.\nThe rooms are large and the bathroom has all ammentites. The Bathroom is designed so well that has a bath tub and separate enclosure for Toilet and bathroom.\nThe Houskeeping staff was very prompt. Specially Harshali who always attended to our requirements and she cleaned the rooms perfectly. Was very impressive.\nThe in room dining attended to all our needs and services but the timeline for serving should be improved as we had to call many times.\nThe hotel had made lovely arrangements for Independence day celebrations. They had tea coffee and snacks in the lobby with classical dance and music. They even had sweet dish plate in our rooms.\nThe Breakfast at  Shamiana was superb. The spread was fabulous with so much variety for Veg and Non veg. There were so many options in live counter for dosas, eggs, pancakes, parathas, puris, french toast etc. Maybe one day would love to drive down just for breakfast.\nMaybe one improvement can be made is to have a small play area for kids which we missed.\nThe ground level also has banquet rooms and ballroom. This will be good for destination wedding or corporate events.\nAnother beautiful highlight we saw was the way the hotel security lowered the flag after sunset and completed the formality with respect. The true way to do it even when nobody is watching. Was very proud of Taj Trees",

Westin really needs to fix the house keeping security gap, pre-arrival experience and chef glitches. Most of the folks try harder ( like Ms.Jasmina, head of Housekeeping/Rooms, lounge staff ,the female sous chef etc) to ensure a great experience while others like the front desk, the male sous chef etc doesn't give a damn bringing down the overall experience.\n\nMore details below -\n\nPre-arrival Experience: 1/5. No body called and checked on the arrival time, we wanted an airport pickup which didn't happen, nobody even picked the call at their hotel number given. No response to chat either and finally when I got a call back and while conversing with a staff , she abruptly cut the call. Not a typical Marriott experience to start with, disappointing\n\nArrival Experience: 5/5. After the disastrous pre-arrival experience, Ms.Jasmina stepped in and fixed the experience for us, with a quick call,  an upgrade and welcomed us with providing a small cake and helped us with the occasion celebration welcome as well.\n\nRooms: 4.5/5. Spacious, huge rooms which is rare in Mumbai. View is off the highways and walking space around the property. Very close to Oberoi Mall.\n\nPrivacy/Safety + Housekeeping : 3/5. We had a huge security incident involving housekeeping. Ms. Jasmina again stepped in, apologized, brought the issue to the attention of the relevant people and helped sorting it out. Other than that, requests were promptly attended to, cleanliness was maintained.\n\nFood : 4/5. We had dinner and breakfast. Dinner lacked continental and seafood. Apparently they had pasta which the team never informed us, which was surprising. The varieties were there at both time and the female sous chef was super friendly ensuring the concerns were addressed. During breakfast, they ensured we get French toast. The male sous chef ( I guess) was super rude and when I asked for koki , he said \" Go, talk to the server and place the order, not to me\" if so, he shouldn't hang around the food counter and ask what do people want. If he doesn't want to do what's asked, then he shouldn't ask. Bizarre behavior. During dinner, they struggled to manage the crowd. A huge container of uncooked chicken was kept in the open kitchen behind the food counters for a long time which wasn't a good health indicator.\n\nFew glitches needs to be addressed which is evident from the other reviews as well.",

            "text": "We recently had the pleasure of staying at the newly opened Fairmont Mumbai Sahar, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations on every front. From the moment you enter, the architecture, interiors, and the sheer grandeur of the property make it clear that this is not just another 5-star hotel \u2013 it\u2019s a true luxury retreat right in the heart of Mumbai.\n\nLocation & Convenience\nOne of the biggest advantages is its proximity to the airport \u2013 it's literally a 5-minute drive from the international terminal, which is a game-changer if you're flying in or out at odd hours. Despite being so close to the airport, once you're inside, it's peaceful and quiet \u2013 a perfect blend of convenience and calm.\n\nRooms & Views\nThe rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and thoughtfully equipped with everything a modern traveler could need. My room had a lovely view overlooking the landscaped pool and garden area (was under maintenance) The bed was supremely comfortable, linens were high-quality, and the bathroom (with its fab bathtub)\n\nDining Experience at The Merchants\nA special shoutout to Sutanuka, who helped us with our restaurant reservations at The Merchants. Her warmth, efficiency, and attention to detail made the entire dining experience feel personalized and memorable. The buffet spread at The Merchants was nothing short of spectacular \u2013 especially for vegetarians, which is often overlooked at luxury hotels. From Indian to Mediterranean and Asian cuisine, the variety was impressive. And the dessert station? A dream come true. Beautifully presented, and even better tasting \u2013 especially the mini pastries and the live ice cream counter!\n\nCoffee & Cakes at Madeleine De Proust\nAnother gem within the hotel is their patisserie and caf\u00e9, Madeleine De Proust. Here, Ambika, the manager, was absolutely delightful. She knew her menu inside out and recommended some fantastic options. The cakes are some of the best I\u2019ve had in Mumbai \u2013 light, moist, and not overly sweet. Their signature chocolate cake and the hazelnut \u00e9clair deserve a special mention. The coffee too \u2013 smooth, strong, and served just right.\n\nInteriors & Architecture:\nEvery corner of the Hotel has thoughtful and extremly inspiring forms of art. From paintings to sculptures. Beautifully designed Interiors makes the place warm, hospitable but exciting!\n\nOverall Experience\nThe service across the hotel was consistently warm and polished \u2013 the kind you expect from a Fairmont but rarely see executed so well in a newly launched property. Every staff member, from concierge to housekeeping, seemed genuinely invested in making guests feel welcome.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhether you're a business traveler needing to stay close to the airport, or someone just looking to enjoy a weekend of luxury and pampering in the city, Fairmont Mumbai Sahar is a phenomenal choice. It\u2019s rare to find a hotel that combines stunning design, exceptional service, and culinary brilliance under one roof \u2013 and this one does it seamlessly.\n\nAlready looking forward to my next stay.",
