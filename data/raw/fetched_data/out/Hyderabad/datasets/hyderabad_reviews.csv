⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
We had a wonderful dining experience at Marriott. The staff is extremely humble and polite. We had ordered tofu, but it turned out a bit too spicy for us. Without any hesitation, they cancelled the dish and did not charge us for it. Such thoughtful service and customer care truly deserve appreciation. Thank you for the warmth and hospitality — we will definitely visit again!

As Marriott Bonvoy Reward members, we chose the Hyderabad Marriott, and it didn't disappoint. The concierge team at the Courtyard Marriott was extremely helpful in transferring us to the Marriott. The guestrooms were quite nice, and the food was excellent. Both the breakfast buffet and in-room dining were top-notch. The staff at the Okra restaurant—Madhusheee, Tamisha, Mohan, and Priyankar—took great care of us. The next time I visit Hyderabad, I will definitely return to the Marriott.",2025-07-15T21:17:11.384048719Z,a month ago

The food at their restaurants was good. The breakfast spread was a good mix of local and other options. The staff was courteous. The property also has a grand convention centre, making it ideal for both leisure and business travelers.

hyd001,hyd001_r5,ballista traveler,5,"I spent a few days at the Hyderabad Marriott Hotel before my flight, and it was exactly what I needed.
While the hotel is not new, the service was truly exceptional—the staff went out of their way to help, and even prepared non-spicy meals for me daily. The massage was also excellent.

I came from a larger, flashier hotel but found this one much cozier and more relaxing. The view of the lake from the lobby brought a welcome sense of calm after time in the chaos of the city. I mostly stayed in the hotel to work, and it was a perfect setting.

If you’re looking to rest and be well taken care of, I highly recommend it.",2025-06-18T09:27:14.748652662Z,2 months ago

The first room (516) that we got was not in the best of shape. The rooms needs loads of renovation there was leakage and mould on the walls. The washrooms needs loads serious work to be done.

We shifted our room to (516) which was a very nice room. Again serious work to be done in the washrooms.

The staff were friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was welcoming, our staying was exceptional, we were there for four nights and we couldn’t be more satisfied with our choice.

hyd002,hyd002_r3,saran drk,1,"Absolutely Horrible Stay – Feels Like a Haunted Dungeon

I don’t usually leave reviews, but I feel morally obligated to warn others about this place. Staying at Amrutha Castle was hands down one of the most disgusting, disappointing, and creepy hotel experiences I’ve ever had in my life.

From the second you step in, the place gives off the most depressing, haunted-house energy.

Basic amenities? Forget about it.

No water bottle in the room.

No kettle.

No door mat.

NO exhaust fan in the bathroom (get ready to bathe in a steam chamber).

No shower or rinse area near the swimming pool—because apparently hygiene is optional here.

The management? A joke. Completely clueless, unprofessional, and seem to operate in their own world of apathy. It’s almost like they enjoy watching guests suffer. Zero sense of hospitality.

Honestly, the whole place reeks of negligence. It’s the kind of hotel that makes you want to shower twice after checking out—once to wash off the filth, and once to wash off the regret of booking it in the first place.

This stay wasn’t just bad. It was a waste of money, time, and sanity. If you’re even thinking about staying here, DON’T. Save your money and your soul. You’ve been warned.",2025-06-08T13:56:04.460625Z,2 months ago
hyd002,hyd002_r4,Sai Krishna Vamsi Madireddi,1,"This place is an absolute disaster. I booked a stay here last month expecting a decent experience, but what I got was a dirty, neglected, and poorly maintained hotel that shouldn't be in business.

The room was filthy, with mold on the walls, stains on the furniture, and a patched-up sofa that was falling apart. The bed was unusable—springs sticking out, zero support, and downright unsafe. You could genuinely hurt your back sleeping on it.

Nothing in the room worked—the TV was dead, the landline was non-functional, and there was no drinking water or kettle provided. The bathroom was even worse—no dry area, no mat, no exhaust fan, and everything looked like it hadn’t been cleaned properly in months.

The staff were rude and unhelpful. They had no clue what was going on and weren’t interested in helping either. I asked for plates to eat food I ordered from outside and was told flat out: “We don’t give plates unless you order from our kitchen.” Who does that in the hospitality business?

The first room they gave me on the second floor looked like something from a medieval prison. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it in a hotel.

This is supposed to be part of the Country Club network, and as a long-time member, I’m shocked and disappointed. The quality has hit rock bottom.

Do yourself a favor—don’t book here. This place will ruin your holiday. There are far better hotels in the same price range nearby. Avoid this dump completely.",2025-07-30T15:17:17.298032674Z,a month ago
hyd002,hyd002_r5,Alekhya Kurella,1,"I had one of the worst experiences of my life staying at Amrutha Castle. I checked in last month, and what I encountered was nothing short of a nightmare.

The room was in a terrible condition—dirty, moldy, stained, and filled with patched-up furniture that looked like it belonged in a junkyard. The sofa was torn, and the bed springs were broken, posing a real risk of injury (seriously, it felt dangerous for the spine). The landline didn’t work, and neither did the TV.

The bathroom was a horror show. No separate shower area, no dry area, no floor mat, no exhaust fan, and not even basic amenities like a kettle or drinking water. Everything looked old, neglected, and unhygienic.

The staff? That’s another disaster. Completely unprofessional, unresponsive, and downright rude. I was shocked when they refused to provide plates for outside food, saying: “We only give plates if you order food from us. Bye.” That’s the level of service.

Initially, I was given a room on the second floor—it honestly felt like a prison cell from Game of Thrones. (You can check the photos online—it’s unbelievable that this place calls itself a hotel, let alone part of the Country Club.)

I’ve been a Country Club member for 10 years, and this is by far the worst experience I’ve ever had with the vacation club. It’s embarrassing that this property is even affiliated with them.

If you care about your health, hygiene, and peace of mind—do not bring your family or friends here. This is not a hotel, it’s a dungeon masquerading as one. Stay far away.",2025-07-30T15:09:08.723892134Z,a month ago

The hotel offers beautifully designed, spacious rooms with impressive views that add to the charm of the experience. The atmosphere is positive and calming, making it a perfect place to unwind whether you're traveling for business or leisure.

The hospitality here is top-notch , the staff are courteous, attentive, and go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. A highlight of the experience was the elaborate breakfast spread  both wide in variety and excellent in quality. The in-house dining also delivers consistently good food.

This is my fourth stay at Trident Hyderabad, and each time I am left amazed by the warmth, professionalism, and genuine care of the entire team. I came here for my family member’s treatment at AGI, and staying at Trident has always made a challenging time so much more comfortable and reassuring.

The staff are truly outstanding – from the warm welcome at check-in to the attentive service throughout the stay, they never fail to make me feel cared for. A very special mention must go to the breakfast team, who went above and beyond by thoughtfully packing food for my parents every single day with so much care and consideration. These small gestures, done with a big heart, reflect the spirit of true hospitality.

The rooms are immaculate, the food is excellent, and the atmosphere is both peaceful and uplifting – exactly what one needs during such visits. What sets Trident apart, however, is the people – their kindness and dedication turn every stay into a memorable experience.

Thank you, Trident Hyderabad, for once again making me feel at home. I look forward to returning, not just for the comfort, but for the incredible team that defines this place. 🌸",2025-08-24T16:23:11.122329498Z,a week ago

Trident is one of the best 5 star Hotels in Hyderabad. Centrally located in Hi-tech city well connected to all useful places within reach in 10 minutes

Rooms are modern and well equipped with best in class furniture and fixtures to make stay absolutely comfortable and memorable.

Breakfast is well spread with Noth Indian, south Indian and continental food. Timing is  7am till 10.30am. Hotel staffs are very helpful and courteous.

In room dining has very good service but charge of tea and coffee is 354 plus taxes 🙄

They had kept leftover stir-fried veggies and noodles from the previous night. My husband complained about a hair in the stir-fried veggies; instead of replacing the dish, the staff merely removed the hair and brought back the same plate. Their service became pathetic when a sudden rush arrived at the restaurant. The staff stopped paying attention to our needs, as they were fully focused on a celebrity who had arrived at the same time. Apart from the food experience, the room service was pathetic too. We called the staff to get the asset locker fixed, but their technician arrived an hour later, only after we had repeatedly called to remind them. After that, the technician took another half an hour to fix it. We were in a hurry to explore the city but got delayed because of their pathetic service.",2025-06-26T06:26:12.548876115Z,2 months ago

hyd005,hyd005_r1,kee pho,1,"I had high expectations from The Park Hyderabad, but the experience turned out to be disappointing. From the start, the vibe felt off – the lobby begins on the 3rd floor and lacked the welcoming feel I expected. The reception had all new faces who seemed inexperienced, which didn’t help.

The hotel’s design feels flawed. The swimming pool is placed right next to the dining area, which makes swimming uncomfortable and also raises concerns about diners accidentally dropping things into the pool. My room had a bathtub with no proper drainage, so water spilled into the room. The only good part was the cleaning staff on the 8th floor who kept cleaning up the mess – though it clearly seemed like a daily extra burden for them due to poor planning.

The passages were dimly lit, there was no proper gym, and the balcony had no view. While some of the 3rd-floor staff were decent, the bar staff mocked customer choices – something I’d never expect in a 5-star hotel. The overall vibe felt more like a casual hangout spot rather than a premium hospitality experience.

Not the luxury stay I had hoped for. Management really needs to address these issues.",2025-08-26T17:44:19.040614173Z,a week ago

What I dislike is that this 5 star hotel does not have good service. They delay and delay and delay, and make up excuses for every single problem created. No one in the hotel will admit that the inefficiency or bad food is because of their fault, they do “compensate” by slashing the prices down but that really is not the point. If you do not care about service this is a good fit for you, but for a 5 star hotel this is lacking.

The room, while decently sized, lacked attention to detail. The cleanliness wasn’t up to the mark, the linens felt worn out, and the bathroom amenities were basic at best. There was a sense that the space hadn’t been refreshed or maintained well, which was disappointing given the premium pricing.

Plus they collect full payment for booked duration at the time of check in and do NOT refund if you want to cancel, modify or there are any issues.  No one from reservation team answers properly and only diects to other person.

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by how spotlessly clean the entire hotel was. The staff were incredibly friendly and approachable, always ready to assist with a warm smile.

One of the highlights was definitely the breakfast! As vegetarians, we were delighted with the wide array of delicious options, including some wonderful local cuisines. Huge kudos to the chef for preparing everything so incredibly tasty – it was a real treat each morning. We also found the food prices to be very affordable, with their Thali being a particularly great value.

The F&B Manager provided exceptional service, though a bit more attentiveness and approachability from other staff members would further enhance the dining experience.

That said, the rest of the stay more than made up for it. The staff were warm and welcoming, the swimming pool was large and inviting, and the jacuzzi worked perfectly. Breakfast had a great spread and the service felt very well trained. The property seemed small at first glance but turned out to be more spacious than I expected.

One small downside was the bar area staff — they weren’t as polished or attentive as the rest of the team and felt a bit hit-or-miss, which was surprising in an otherwise well-run hotel.

hyd011,hyd011_r3,Arvind Garg,4,"From the moment I arrived, I was thoroughly impressed by the elegance and grandeur of the hotel building. The architecture seamlessly blends classic sophistication with modern luxury, creating a stunning first impression.
Inside, the aesthetic is equally captivating. Every space—from the lobby to the hallways and rooms—has been thoughtfully designed with an eye for detail. The interiors are warm, refined, and filled with character.
One of the standout features for me was the artwork throughout the hotel. The carefully curated paintings on the walls added a cultural and artistic depth that elevated the overall ambiance.
The staff were consistently professional, courteous, and genuinely welcoming. Whether it was the front door guards, front desk or housekeeping everyone went out of their way to ensure a comfortable and memorable stay. Their warmth and attentiveness truly set this hotel apart.

But unfortunately, the breakfast service on 03-08-2025 fell well below the mark.
Despite the elegant setting, the service was disorganized and inattentive. We waited an unreasonably long time just to be seated.
On buffet, some items were also cold and out of stock. Waiters were less in required number. We had to ask multiple times for puris and our order of dosa and uttapam from live counter-things that should be readily available at this level of service.  On sensing we are being irritated on level of service, incharge Mr. Sharath took interest in serving our order before things go awry.  I sensed they are ill prepared to serve breakfast in case of full occupancy of hotel.
For a hotel of this caliber, I expected efficiency, warmth, and attention to serve. Instead, it felt more like an over-burdened buffet than a luxury experience. Management should seriously reconsider staff training and supervision during breakfast hours, as this experience may leave lasting negative impression on an otherwise beautiful property.

We stayed in Room #110, and the housekeeping service was prompt and efficient. When we requested for the sofa to be made into an extra bed, the housekeeping staff responded quickly and completed the task without delay. Room service was also fast and satisfactory.

At the time of checkout, we requested help with our luggage by calling the housekeeping number, and a lady promptly arrived at our room to assist. To our pleasant surprise, we met her again at the reception—she was very polite and kind, though unfortunately, I don’t recall her name.

Thank you to the entire Hyatt team for making our stay a memorable one.

One suggestion: If space permits, it would be great to have a dedicated kids’ zone or activity area where children can play and enjoy.

hyd012,hyd012_r5,Admin India Agripv Alliance,2,"Had convened a roundtable consultation here, and unfortunately, the experience was far below expectations. Our organization has been organizing events at various Hyatt properties across India, and this was by far the most disappointing.

The sales team was quite misleading. Initially, they tried charging extra for the hall over and above the cost of food per person, citing that the designated venue is only provided with a minimum guarantee of 40 guests - (gracious enough to allow us to host our event at the property, despite not meeting that number). Ironically, when we visited the venue a day before the event, the designated space could barely accommodate 25 people in a roundtable setup. There was hardly any room to move, and the placement of the screen, projector, and backdrop was poorly planned. The podium couldn’t even be accommodated.

The sales team also insisted on shifting our group of 30–35 guests to the restaurant for lunch instead of serving it in the foyer area, citing concerns about food wastage. After a lot of back-and-forth communication, they eventually agreed to serve lunch at the foyer of the venue (Grateful!)

While Hyatt is known for its hospitality, Hyatt Place Hyderabad was a letdown in both planning and service. Would not recommend this property for professional events.",2025-07-28T10:19:02.785614183Z,a month ago

The hotel looks nothing like the photos online—those must have been heavily edited to mislead potential guests. Once you're there, you’re left with no real choice but to stay.

We had no water supply for over four hours on the morning of our checkout. When we tried to get help, the staff told us to ""hold on,"" kept hanging up on us, and avoided any conversation at the reception.

hyd019,hyd019_r5,Wali,5,"Comfortable, Kid-Friendly Stay with Great Location & Staff.

Stayed here for a week with my wife and two kids( 7 and 3 year old) and had a genuinely pleasant experience. The location is a big plus , almost everything important is within 15–20 minutes: Hitech City, railway station, Toli Chowki, Charminar, etc. The area around the hotel is vibrant, surrounded by sweet shops, dosa/idli vendors, pan stalls, Masqati dairy, Chinese joints, Paradise, Shah Ghouse, and other major restaurants.

A huge bonus was that Hussain Sagar Lake is just a 15-minute walk from the hotel, right next to the new Secretariat. We strolled there every night, very peaceful and enjoyable. You can also take a Rapido auto for around ₹50 if you don’t feel like walking.

The staff was absolutely amazing.  Noor and Dinesh were super helpful and always available.  Special thanks to Safeera and her colleague from housekeeping – they were so friendly with our kids, letting them play in the hallway without any complaints and even joining in sometimes. It made a big difference, especially during long days indoors. The two cleaning ladies were also wonderful, kept our room spotless every day and stayed in touch with my wife and kids with warm, friendly conversations.

The housekeeping, room service, and front desk teams were all top-notch. There is a 24/7 front desk, and security was always present. The lift is a little old-school, but it works fine. Rooms are decent-sized and comfortable for the price.

Only Downside: the restaurant, which is managed separately, had a few staff members and a manager who weren’t very hospitable, rude over small things like asking for an extra plate/bowls.  But the hotel staff more than made up for that experience.

Overall, this was a very family-friendly stay, and we made some great memories here. Will definitely be coming back. For any reservations or hotel-related issues help, reach out to Vikrant , he is your guy, super helpful and responsive.",2025-06-21T07:45:06.129116228Z,2 months ago

hyd020,hyd020_r2,Srinivas Chilukuri,1,"Review on Ibis Hotel Hi-Tech City, Hyderabad

I had a very disappointing experience at Ibis Hotel Hi-Tech City. They don’t even allow food delivery or outside food to be collected at the reception, which is extremely inconvenient for guests. Even top luxury hotels like Park Hyatt allow guests to receive their food parcels at reception without any issues, but Ibis seems to lack even basic customer-friendly policies.

The staff were rigid and showed no flexibility or understanding of guest needs. For a hotel that claims to be “business-friendly” and guest-oriented, this kind of restriction feels very unreasonable and reflects poor hospitality standards.

Overall, a very worst experience. Definitely not worth recommending when there are so many better hotels around that respect and value their guests.",2025-08-29T10:51:57.398146661Z,a week ago
hyd020,hyd020_r3,Joann Cherian,3,"We had a 1 night stay at the ibis hotel at HITECH City Hyderabad.  Location is a bit crowded  but still great in terms of easy accessibility. The staff (very polite and customer friendly) and the restaurant services were decent. We had  pizza and complimentary breakfast buffet from their restaurant. Pizza was good enough. The complimentary breakfast had many varieties but food can be considered only average.
But overall,  the stay was an unpleasant experience for the price charged. The standard room and the bathroom were too congested and not well maintained or cleaned. We were charged extra for the occupancy of 3 adults in a room which is fair enough but the room did not even have space for an additional bed. The already existing beds though comfortable,  were two separate single beds put together as one. Bathroom sink was not clean, old looking rusted trash cans, and the shower area was too congested as well.  Completely unsatisfied with the stay.  Definitely not met the standard for the price charged.  Although the customer service is to be appreciated,  I would never recommend to anyone looking for clean comfortable rooms.",2025-08-05T12:18:22.989092010Z,a month ago

hyd024,hyd024_r5,Subas Chandran,5,"Park Hyatt is one of the addresses for hospitality, still warm, still appreciative, but with that extra sprinkle of spice to tickle the funny bone. The staff's humor added a delightful touch to the experience.
If hospitality were an Olympic sport, this dream team would’ve taken home the gold, silver, and the buffet table.
Let’s start with Kareena, the receptionist, and Raj, the Duty Manager, who managed duties, guests, and occasional mood swings (mine, not hers) with the grace of a ballet dancer and the precision of a Swiss watch. Their ability to fix a problem before it even thought of becoming one made me feel like a truly valued guest.
At the front office, Abid and Abu were like Batman and Robin regarding guest relations. Need a room change? Done. Did you lose your key card? Found. Existential crisis? Well, they’d at least offer you tea with a reassuring smile.
Avinash, the F&B Manager, ensured I never left the dining area hungry—or skinny. Every meal felt like a Michelin-starred cheat day, and I didn’t complain once. My diet did, though. Loudly.
Then came Mr. Gerald, RM of Rika, a guide, who explained how to explore Hyatt points and membership, while Mukesh, our restaurant livewire.
Over at the fitness centre, Karthik tried valiantly to undo the damage caused by Avinash’s delicious sabotage. Whether it was treadmill therapy or gentle guilt-tripping, he had me moving—and miraculously smiling guide to his domain.
Rakesh Bhandari transformed breakfast into a daily celebration. I thought I was just grabbing toast and eggs, but no—he served joy with a side of “Try this too!” Every morning felt like brunch at grandma’s as if grandma were a gourmet chef with five-star charm.
And then, Krishna Rana. Not just a chef but a culinary wizard slash philosopher. Our conversations went from recipes to the meaning of life, all while he casually whipped up magic on a plate.
This band of pampering professionals didn’t just make my stay comfortable—they turned it into a sitcom, a food documentary, and a luxury retreat. Their dedication and humor made every moment a memorable experience.
If the home is where the heart is, then this place felt like a warm hug from a five-star hotel wrapped in laughter, good food, and people who genuinely care.",2025-04-17T14:42:08.024537Z,4 months ago

Overall Experience

Your experience at Katriya Hotel was marred by several issues, primarily with the room's air conditioning, which wasn't working properly. This is a basic amenity, especially in Hyderabad's climate, and its absence can make your stay uncomfortable.

Cleanliness and Maintenance

The washroom's poor condition is a major concern. Cleanliness is a fundamental expectation from any hotel, and the state of the washroom fell short of those expectations. This suggests a lack of attention to detail in maintaining the hotel's facilities.

Service Quality

The room service was also subpar, which can be frustrating when you're expecting assistance with your needs. More concerning, however, is the receptionist and staff's apparent lack of attentiveness to customer needs. This indicates a potential issue with the hotel's customer service standards.

Food

On a more positive note, the restaurant seemed to offer some good options, although you mentioned a limited variety of food. This could be an area the hotel might want to focus on to improve the overall guest experience.

Suggestions for Improvement

To address these issues, the hotel could consider the following:
- *Regular Maintenance*: Ensure that all amenities, including AC and washrooms, are regularly checked and maintained to prevent such issues.

- *Staff Training*: Provide customer service training to staff to enhance their attentiveness and responsiveness to guest needs.

- *Quality Control*:
Implement stricter quality control measures to ensure that rooms and facilities meet expected standards.

- *Menu Expansion*: Consider expanding the menu options in the restaurant to cater to a wider range of tastes and preferences.

Conclusion

While Katriya Hotel has some redeeming qualities, the issues you've highlighted need attention to ensure a comfortable and satisfying stay for guests. By addressing these concerns, the hotel can work towards providing a better experience for its customers",2025-08-07T05:49:51.517392653Z,a month ago

My recent stay at this hotel was quite disappointing. From the moment I checked in, the experience was underwhelming.

Room:
The room was extremely congested—there was barely any space to move around. It felt cramped and uncomfortable, making it hard to relax or even unpack properly.

Service & Charges:
What really shocked me was being charged ₹200 just for asking for a couple of empty plates. This felt unreasonable and gave the impression that the hotel is more focused on squeezing money out of guests than offering genuine hospitality.

Cleanliness & Comfort:
While the room was moderately clean, the overall atmosphere lacked comfort. The layout and size of the room made the stay feel claustrophobic.

Value for Money:
Given the condition of the room and the ridiculous extra charges, I do not feel this hotel was worth the price. There are definitely better options available at the same or even lower rates.

hyd036,hyd036_r5,Neeraj Chodankar,1,"I had booked suite for 2 nights The hotel staff are super nice and very cooperative, but it feels like the owner or whoever manages this place is least bothered about maintenance. Our check-in time was 12, but we arrived around 2 pm, and I could already sense something was off. I overheard the staff informing the owner/operator that the toilet seat was broken, to which he casually replied, “Give it as it is,” and the staff were rightly questioning how they could hand over a room like that.
Apart from that, the entrance has constant sewage water flowing, which makes the entrance area smell unpleasant. At night, there was nonstop honking till almost 3 am, making it hard to sleep. Theres no proper hot water sometimes it does sometimes Dont.Even the door locks in the rooms don’t function properly.
The only good thing about this hotel is the staff, who genuinely try their best. If you’re okay overlooking all these issues, you can book here otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend it.",2025-08-25T08:05:26.367309284Z,a week ago

The rooms were clean and functional, offering a no-frills, basic setup ideal for travelers seeking simplicity and comfort. While the decor was minimal, everything was well-maintained and tidy, making for a pleasant stay.

Location & Accessibility:
The hotel’s location was spot-on for exploring the city, with major attractions and commercial areas within easy reach. However, being in a busy part of town, guests should be prepared to deal with traffic noise and congestion throughout the day.

Dining Experience:
Breakfast was a highlight, offering a generous spread of cuisines to suit various tastes. The South Indian options stood out, especially the soft, fluffy idlis paired with a spicy and tangy chutney that was absolutely delicious. The variety and quality of food made for a satisfying start to the day.

Bathroom & Amenities:
Bathrooms were hygienic and thoughtfully equipped with essential toiletries. Everything was placed conveniently, and cleanliness was clearly a priority, contributing to a comfortable and hassle-free experience.",2025-08-04T03:05:33.448240773Z,a month ago

hyd037,hyd037_r5,VeNkY TiLLU,3,"I recently visited Hotel Marigold and, while the stay was generally pleasant, I noticed something that left a lasting impression—not in a good way.

After meals were served to guests, there was often a large quantity of leftover food. Unfortunately, instead of finding a more thoughtful solution, the hotel staff simply threw all the remaining food into the dustbin. It was disheartening to see so much good food go to waste, especially when there are many people in need who would benefit greatly from such generosity.

In today’s world, where hunger is still a major issue, it would be far more meaningful if establishments like Hotel Marigold partnered with local charities, food banks, or community shelters to donate the surplus food. Not only would this reduce waste, but it would also show a sense of social responsibility and compassion.

Hotel Marigold has the potential to set a positive example. The food is good, the service is efficient—but making a small change in how leftovers are handled could elevate the hotel's reputation and impact the community positively.

I truly hope they consider this in the future. A little effort can go a long way in making the world a better place.",2025-06-05T08:25:54.403465Z,3 months ago

Breakfast is included in the stay and is quite satisfying; I especially enjoyed the idli and chutney, which were fresh and flavorful.

However, the property seems to have been converted from a hospital, and the layout and design reflect that. It doesn’t quite have the typical Holiday Inn feel, but the central location and reasonable pricing help balance that out.

One area that definitely needs improvement is the linen quality. The bedsheets, pillow covers, and towels feel dated and worn out—they should be upgraded as a priority to match basic expectations of comfort and hygiene.

Staying at Ella Hotel, Gachibowli, Hyderabad was an absolute disaster. This place is the textbook example of how a hotel should NOT be run.

Let’s start with the staff – the front desk receptionists are shockingly rude, arrogant, and completely lack even basic communication skills. They behave more like goondas than hospitality professionals. No respect, no courtesy, no willingness to help. I’ve never encountered such hostile, untrained behavior in any hotel.

Then there’s the gym trainer, who apparently also maintains the swimming pool. He is completely unprofessional, aggressive, and behaves like a street thug. His presence alone is enough to make guests feel uncomfortable.

The rooms? A joke. Tiny, suffocating, smelly cubes with zero ambience. They charge nearly ₹7000 for what feels like a cheap, budget lodge room. Absolutely no value for money.

And don’t be fooled by the fake positive reviews online. There’s a huge disconnect between the reality and the artificially inflated ratings. It’s obvious many of these reviews are planted – no genuine guest would rate this place highly after what I experienced.

The management is clueless, careless, and full of attitude. Guest complaints are ignored, problems are shrugged off, and there’s zero accountability. This hotel does not value guests at all.

STAY AWAY from this place. It’s overpriced, unprofessional, and borderline hostile. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone – even if it were free.",2025-07-26T10:57:14.788567898Z,a month ago

hyd046,hyd046_r2,SN,1,"Thanks for ruining my vacation time.

Nothing quite says ""luxury hospitality"" like waking up to discover you've somehow time-traveled back to camping - minus the scenic outdoors, of course.

The morning water shortage was such a thoughtful touch - who needs basic amenities when you're paying premium hotel rates? And the one-hour wait for a bucket of water? clearly they're operating on ""island time"" even though we're nowhere near an island.

But wait, it gets better! Apparently, there's this magical thing called ""renovation"" happening that somehow makes water disappear. Revolutionary stuff, really. And the best part? They graciously suggested I should have checked their website *after* booking to learn about these delightful surprises. Because obviously, that's exactly what every traveler does - obsessively refresh hotel websites post-booking for fun little updates like ""Oh, by the way, we forgot to mention we don't have running water!""

The sheer audacity of taking bookings while basically operating a construction site with beds is truly admirable. Why let a little thing like ""providing basic services"" get in the way of collecting payment, right?

Needless to say, I've requested a refund. Hopefully, their refund process works better than their plumbing. Though given this experience, I'm not holding my breath - unlike how I had to hold my breath waiting for that bucket of water.

Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to cosplay as a pioneer or if you enjoy paying five-star prices for a one-star adventure",2025-08-19T13:44:29.745411690Z,2 weeks ago

Right from the moment I walked in, Sanjay at the Reception made me feel like a valued guest. His polite conversation and seamless check-in set the perfect tone for my stay. It’s rare to find someone who combines professionalism with genuine hospitality the way he does.

Dining at Momo Café was another highlight. Shridhar’s attentive service and friendly nature turned every meal into a delightful experience. He ensured that my kid was well taken care of, and his personal touch made the difference.

The hotel itself is immaculate, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the overall vibe is both modern and welcoming. But what truly stood out was the people—they made my stay special.

Thank you, Courtyard by Marriott Hyderabad, for such a wonderful experience. I’ll definitely be returning and recommending this hotel to family, friends, and colleagues.",2025-08-25T16:16:01.011286683Z,a week ago

When asked, they just say, “We’ve put up the sticker that outside food is not allowed, so even if we allow it, we won’t provide any plates or cutlery,” and they say it very rudely.

My room phone was not working. I complained multiple times, but they never fixed it. Their attitude was as if they just didn’t care — “we can’t do much” is all they said.

Further they don't even allow to pick up the fruit(banana) and go..
One day I was getting late to the office. So Thought of picking up just the banana and go to office.

But they rudely said we have to eat here only.

There were too many cockroaches, even in the restaurant area during breakfast, which was very unhygienic. Shockingly, we even found cockroaches inside the chocos served at breakfast.

The lighting in the rooms and bathrooms was very dim, making the spaces feel dull and uncomfortable.

They didn’t provide toiletries for the first two days, and we had to keep reminding them.

What was worse is that when we raised these concerns, the staff were rude and seemed completely ignorant of our complaints.

I recently stayed at Golconda Resorts & Spa for 2 days with my family. We had booked 4 rooms and were allotted the Palm Villas, each priced at ₹15,000 per night — shockingly higher than many 5-star hotels in Hyderabad.

Unfortunately, the experience was far from premium. The rooms were in a pathetic condition. There is no proper drainage system; the showers were clogged and only 2 holes were functioning, with bore water full of waste. The bathtubs are directly connected to drainage pipes without filters, making them unusable and unhygienic. The bathrooms were sinking, and the foul smell even entered the bedrooms.

When I raised these concerns the next morning, the front desk casually said all rooms are like this and that they were sold out — clearly showing no interest in customer satisfaction.

Room service was equally poor. You need to call multiple times before anyone even responds. For a place that charges premium prices, the service and quality are severely lacking.

I do not recommend this resort to anyone. It’s overpriced, poorly maintained, and not even close to basic hospitality standards.",2025-07-21T08:26:19.818918295Z,a month ago

We only ordered tea, but after witnessing the poor treatment and the lack of organization, we decided to leave immediately. The place lacks proper customer service, basic hospitality, and respect for guests.

My only minor feedback would be that while the staff's friendliness was appreciated, some interactions, including extended chats and frequent requests for Google reviews, occasionally felt a little intrusive.

I hope the hotel considers a more streamlined approach to guest feedback, as the current multi-channel requests (Google reviews, WhatsApp pings, and additional forms) can feel overwhelming and repetitive after a long business trip, detracting slightly from an otherwise excellent stay.

But recently they are also marketing it as a casual dining place with a lot of offers on the deal apps like Little and Nearbuy.

They have a a lunch buffet which you can get at a steal price of 449 or thereabouts on the apps and that would be a great way to enjoy a weekend or weekday lunch .

The place is quiet and feels aloof from the crowded streets though its at the heart of the city.

I had the buffet here and it was a nice experience albeit with a little hiccups.

Starting with the good things.
The corn flake fritters were delicious and so was the fish majestic .
The chicken biryani despite being on the buffet was a quite good . One of the good biryanis in buffet i've had recently.
The Thai fish curry was delicious too if you love Thai food.
The creamy chicken salad was also great.

The strawberry souffle was delicious and a welcome change of desserts for me in buffet.
The Jalebis , were good , you can always ask them to get it heated .

Now some which need improvement,
The desserts were sub par barring the jalebis and the strawberry souffle.
But the cinnamon cake was really dry though it had the flavors aplenty and The pineapple pastry too wet .
The soup could do with a little salt , i eat very less salt and it felt a little unsalted for me so i think that's something which can be looked at .

Overall, if you get a deal then its a really fine buffet with lots of options for everyone. And as promised by the chef , the food will get better everyday .

hyd056,hyd056_r3,Anil Chambani,3,"A Fantastic Stay with One Major Flaw
My recent visit to Pragati resort was, for the most part, absolutely fantastic. The resort is impeccably clean and well-maintained, with a strong focus on hygiene that was noticeable from the moment we arrived. The sheer amount of space is a huge plus, with beautiful parks and grounds that are perfect for leisurely strolls.
The accommodations were great. Our room was very spacious, and the room service was prompt and efficient. The washrooms, in particular, were the best I've seen at a resort—spotless and well-designed.
However, the food was a major disappointment and the one significant drawback of our stay. It was a complete letdown. There was a noticeable lack of variety, and what was available simply didn't have any flavor. Considering the high quality of everything else, the food was a shocking and frustrating experience. It really wasn't worth the price and left us feeling quite let down.",2025-08-17T07:06:44.783428676Z,2 weeks ago

If toddlers travel with parents who can’t sleep alone without elders don’t like it at all.They will not join the beds as well. Service is not good. If you ask for anything they won’t serve instead they will forget and we too should. Another thing is Go-cart vehicles will be there roaming to drop check in and check out  customers. It was raining but they did not allow to get in with child , though we requested. They might have rules and restrictions but in such situations they should have minimum courtesy to help customers to reach their rooms.
Food was very bad. Not at all worthy. They keep very less varieties in lunch and dinner. In Breakfast nothing was tasty and on time, we need to stand long for Dosa if you want, and no guarantee how they taste. Totally the situation was like they are doing some favour to us.
Instead of all these unacceptable things, there are good things like : beautiful nature, nice water pools, eye loving greenery.. it’s awesome to walk on green meadows of nature..early morning weather and birds chirping makes mind very calm and happy..",2025-08-19T15:59:48.287976467Z,2 weeks ago

The property has its positives: it is close to nature with plenty of greenery, a huge swimming pool, and spacious areas that make for a pleasant evening walk. The resort is vast, making it convenient to host large meetings or corporate gatherings. Rooms are also quite big, which is a plus.

However, maintenance is a major concern. Being an old property, the furniture and fixtures are not well maintained. Bathrooms in the rooms were not clean (something even my friends experienced), and the common restrooms were in poor condition rusted taps, broken fittings, and visible yellow stains.

1. Rooms are very small not spacious. They have installed huge mirrors to make room look huge.
2. Rooms are so stinky with very foul smell. I used room spray continuously to make my stay little comfortable.
3. Towels and bed covers and dohars are too dirty. If I asked new that was washed but by overusage, there look is very dull and dirty.
4. Door handles and locks in very poor condition.
5. Lift is also risky.
6. At space in front of lift they have parked their housekeeping trolleys with other material which they use for housekeeping. That trolley stinks a lot that even you can't stand there to wait for lift arrival.

We booked the hotel for 3 days (around 13th Feb) and wanted to do late checkout as our flight was at 6 pm.
Even after multiple requests to accommodate late checkout (2 hrs more), we were told that the room is booked for next guest and other rooms are not available.

We offered to pay for the extra hours but the hotel managers couldn't arrange alternate room just for couple of hours.

We went out and came back to hotel after 3 hrs to collect the luggage & wanted to use restroom. They gave us the same room keys (where we stayed) to use the restroom. We noticed that neither the room was occupied by any guest nor it was cleaned (ready to occupy for next guest). This was shocking, though after multiple requests neither the room was given to us nor it was occupied.

I didn't expect such experience from Treebo which is renowned for its hospitality.
I hope you accomodate request from customers who come with lot of trust and hope trusting your services.

Daytime service could definitely use improvement but otherwise i would surely consider this place, especially when i am traveling with family or if i am looking for a longer stay. A bit disappointed with the points system managed by Marriott and slightly on the expensive side so that is something to consider.

It is also well located and having a mall with pubs and shopping stuff in the same building can be helpful. There was no noise disturbance from these additions though.

However, the rooms, though comfortable, are not well-maintained, and the overall upkeep of the hotel leaves much to be desired.

The event spaces are functional and well-laid-out, but again, maintenance and service quality fall short of expectations. The staff is average—not particularly warm or efficient, especially given the scale of the property.

Overall, it has good potential for both stays and events, but it really needs better management and upkeep to deliver the experience it promises.",2025-06-23T02:04:50.680345507Z,2 months ago

This policy is both unfair and outdated, and it reflects poorly on how the management treats potential guests from their own city.

The boy who accompanies for check in asks for tips shamelessly within 1 min.However on reporting the management got into quick action and resolved things in couple of hours.

Breakfast was very tasty and had lots of variety - both Indian and Continental dishes.

Rooms - We stayed at 415. Room was quite big and comfortable for 3 of us. However the bathroom was a disappointment. It was big but the shower area had no curtains and due to that after bathing the whole bathroom was splashed with water, wet and slippery. This is a minimum requirement that you expect in any hotel.

Service - Staff showed lots of keenness but our request for putting an extra bed and extra towels wasn't done till we reached late in the night. Was upsetting.

Internet /Wi-Fi - Should allow for a minimum of 4-6 connections per room given that a mobile+laptop is minimum per guest these days. However based on your request the Tech person helped us out.",2025-03-22T05:55:15.603987Z,5 months ago

Both were very good. The ambiance, wifi connection, lobby, restaurant, restrooms were very neatly maintained and they were kept very well.

The only negative is the swimming pool. They have not put anywhere on the sites where we book hotels (at least evidently) that we should carry nylon clothes to use the pool AND they don't have a rental facility too. We went for a spiritual trip and obviously, we may not carry a swimming dress but there could be a provision for us to rent. The management should take this suggestion.

The second one is, they have a lot of vacant land however there is no child play area. That can also be a part of the premises when you have a pool, lawn, outdoor auditorium, and so on. I will rate them 4.5 / 5",2022-11-14T08:36:08.796446Z,2 years ago

The breakfast buffet is decent and just right for those on work, not too large or small in terms of variety and spread. Food is good. Rooms are good and comfortable but sometimes they forget to put a few items which they promptly get you once you remind them. During my stay there was no hand wash soap in the dispenser, apparently they ran out of supply but they had enough soap bars as replacement if you needed. AC was not very responsive or effective. So maintenance needs some looking into especially given the fact it is not a very old property and part of a reputed chain. One downside is though they have smoking rooms, they don't have a smoking area within the property for those who like non-smoking rooms but need to step out for the occasional smoke. Bathrooms are nice and not cramped like a lot of boutique hotels which try to cut bathroom size for no good reason, this one scores in this area. But totally western, with no concept of tap, bucket or mug in the bath area, the shower head is the only source of water in the bath area but the flooring is of stone and hence not slippery.

After exactly 1.5 hours of my call i received a text message due to unavoidable circumstances my booking was cancelled. I was completely speechless. I immediately called the customer care and their response was we are sorry the property was overbooked. How is that possible? When I booked in official app the rooms were available and i have booked by paying the full price. I believe it’s only after I calling to the property about our late check in they somehow cancelled my booking.
I have to fight again for getting my full refund initiated thats a different worst experience all together. Initially i received the mail saying my eligible refund is zero.
Very pathetic worst experience with OYO in this property. I deleted the OYO forever.

He was also incredibly professional, attentive, and always ready to assist, ensuring every guest feels truly valued.

One of the highlights of my stay was the food! The buffet spread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was impressive — not only in variety but also in taste. Every meal was delicious, and it’s clear the chef/master is an expert in their craft. Whether you're in the mood for something light or a hearty meal, there's something for everyone. The quality of ingredients was top-notch, and the flavors were consistently delightful. Best of all, the pricing was very reasonable for the quality and variety offered, even lower than restaurants around there.

The service boys were equally outstanding — polite, well-mannered, and always eager to help with a smile. Communication was smooth, and their hospitality truly made me feel like I was at home. It's rare to find such a perfect blend of professionalism and warmth.

hyd086,hyd086_r1,Sagittarius S,1,"Very bad experience with this hotel, hotel charges extra amount after the online booking, they are listed in breakfast availability in online bookings and customers book the hotel n once they reach they will get surprise that hotel doesnt have any breakfast, but still they will charge the breakfast amount. They will give water bottle only on the first day of checkin, if you stay for a month or any number of days, u need to get your own water bottles. Towels are so dirty, it will look like mopping was done with those n then they rinse n give to customers. Bedsheets n blankets are also very dirty. Almirahs n washroom mugs are broken. Huge crowd of cockroaches will welcome us whenever we come from outside. Hotel managers are very trained in arguments with all the customers. If you need early checkin and even if rooms are available they wont give at all. They will ask to go stay somewhere else for 2-3 hours and come at 12pm only. Internet doest work, phone is just for showoff, it wont work.
Hotel needs to work alot in taking care of cleanliness and should adhere with proper policies in charging n providing amenities and yes attitude of their managers to learn how to talk to customers rather than just being ready for arguments all the time with everyone.",2025-08-09T13:17:23.904484790Z,3 weeks ago

I booked my stay for 5 days but moved out of this place in 1 day.  Following reasons
1. Lift - very very small. Person with one suitcase will only fit.
2. Room - very small. It's a PG converted into budget friendly hotel
3. Bathroom- very small.
4. Cleanliness - room walls had stains. Not at all hotel feeling. Mosquito problems.
5. Safety - While going out of the room. If you wish to lock your room. You use the regular suitcase lock. The smallest lock possible
6. Location - I had a problem of cab willing to come near the hotel. The road to the hotel is like too congested. Only 1 vehicle at a time. Surrounded my PGs.
Will not recommend if you plan to visit with your family. Definitely a budget friendly. I moved out of this hotel and found a cheaper than this but much better options nearby.

The best thing about this franchise is the staffs and the cooperate team. They are really very well behaved and understanding. They did try to help me out with different options at cheaper rate too.

This is hands down one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had — and I feel compelled to share this so other travellers don’t make the same mistake.

The property is dusty, neglected, and crawling with insects and moths. The bed and window linens were mouldy and visibly unclean, making it extremely uncomfortable and unhygienic.

The rooms offer no peace whatsoever. Located on a chaotic main road, the traffic noise is relentless and there's zero soundproofing. Forget a good night’s sleep — you'll be disturbed throughout.

The staff are another major disappointment: untrained, unprofessional and outright rude. Instead of showing basic courtesy or hospitality, they passed inappropriate comments and behaved with a level of arrogance that was shocking. It felt unsafe and uncomfortable.

To top it off, the breakfast was terrible — cold, poorly prepared, and inedible. It left us wondering if food safety standards were even considered.

This property fails on every basic standard of hospitality — hygiene, service, comfort, safety, and food. It's a complete waste of time, money, and energy. Do yourself a favour and don’t even consider this hotel.",2025-08-05T13:02:38.731842523Z,a month ago

I asked if there was any way to get a refund or change the booking, and they just told me to “call customer care.” When I asked for more information, they sarcastically said, “go to the police station if you want.”

I had a wonderful experience staying at this hotel. From check-in to check-out, everything was smooth and comfortable. The staff were extremely polite, friendly, and always ready to help, which made the stay even more pleasant.

The room was clean, well-maintained, and equipped with all the necessary amenities. The bed was comfortable, and the overall ambiance was peaceful and relaxing.

One of the best parts was the morning breakfast ( not included in the package) /300 rs but– it was fresh, tasty, and had a good variety to choose from. A great way to start the day!

The property also has a designated smoking area with seating, a cozy café to grab a quick bite or chill with fellow travelers, and a lovely reading arena filled with a variety of books stacked neatly on shelves. It’s a great spot to unwind or dive into a new read.

One of the highlights is the weekend workshops that are hosted regularly—creative, fun, and a great way to learn something new while connecting with others.

Despite bringing these concerns to the attention of your front desk staff during my stay, the problems were not addressed to my satisfaction.

After checking out, I sent a series of emails on outlining my grievances but I have yet to receive any response from either your General Manager or anyone from your management team.

As a guest, I expect a timely and professional response to any issues that arise, especially when I’ve taken the time to follow proper channels by submitting feedback directly to the hotel. The lack of communication, especially from senior management, is deeply concerning.

I would appreciate it if you could address my concerns promptly. I am still hopeful for a resolution, but my faith in the quality of service at your establishment is significantly diminished due to this lack of follow-through.

My recent 5-day stay at Restel Homestays in Hyderabad was absolutely wonderful, and I can't recommend it highly enough. From the moment I arrived, the hotel felt welcoming and well-cared-for, a testament to its commitment to guest satisfaction.

The first thing that stood out was the impeccable cleanliness and the truly modern infrastructure. Everything, from the common areas to my room, felt fresh and new. It was clear that the management takes great pride in maintaining the property; they are always painting or conducting some sort of update to keep the place in top-notch condition. This constant attention to detail creates an environment that is not only comfortable but also genuinely pleasing to the eye.

What truly elevated my experience, however, was the incredible staff, especially Soni Ma'am at the reception. She is an absolute gem. For any query or need, big or small, Soni Ma'am was the person to reach out to. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was not just comfortable, but genuinely memorable. Her helpfulness, warmth, and dedication deserve immense praise. She truly is the heart of the hotel's hospitality.

For anyone looking for a place to stay in Hyderabad, whether it's for a short visit or an extended period of a month or even a year, Restel Homestays is an excellent choice. Its combination of outstanding cleanliness, modern facilities, and a dedicated, caring team makes it stand out from the rest. I will certainly be back on my next visit.

The rooms are a little small but very neat and clean and prepared for the customer with all the necessary amenities. They have a mini bar inside the room which can be used on a chargeable basis. The washroom is also very small but it has all the required toiletries. They have an amazing restaurant on the first floor which is quite uniquely designed. I liked the spread for the buffet breakfast which almost covered all India based cuisines. Also, the live kitchen was very prompt. They are good listeners, polite and professional. There are many photogenic corners inside the hotel and from the restaurant itself, the restaurant of the hotel, particularly, the reception looks nice. The check in and check out were also smooth.",2025-06-30T18:29:35.792598059Z,2 months ago

hyd132,hyd132_r1,Devansh Rai,2,"Stayed at Hotel Imperial Classic for one night, and it was far from what’s portrayed online. The images and descriptions are quite misleading, and we encountered several unpleasant surprises upon arrival.

We had booked a room for 3 people with two double beds, but were told we’d only get one double bed and a floor mattress instead. Definitely not what we paid for.

The room was small, poorly maintained, and had visible signs of dampness with paint peeling off. There were even tobacco and paan stains on the walls — quite unhygienic. Basic amenities like a water bottle, electric kettle, or tea/coffee weren’t provided either, which is expected at this price point.

The biggest letdown was the so-called “breakfast included”. We were handed a coupon and sent to a nearby roadside stall. While the food there was actually tasty, it was clearly not worth the ₹300 per person we were charged — especially when the same food costs ₹30 if bought directly.

Ah, what can I say — truly an unforgettable stay! If you’re a fan of wildlife documentaries, this place is a hidden gem. I had the unique pleasure of sharing my room with a thriving colony of cockroaches, who clearly considered me the intruder.

Every night was an adventure: I came back hoping for rest and relaxation, but instead got to live out my own episode of Fear Factor, battling bugs until 4 a.m. Spoiler alert: they won. Even with daily anti-cockroach spray, they were so resilient I’m convinced they were wearing hazmat suits.

The shower didn’t work, which was just perfect — nothing like hauling water in a bucket to make you appreciate the finer things in life.
The room was never cleaned, but who needs that when you're already hosting an insect rave?

Oh, and the smell — somewhere between moldy basement and wet flip-flop. A true sensory experience.

Honestly, if you’re looking to bond with nature (very, very closely) and test your immune system, this is the place for you.

hyd135,hyd135_r4,Sudhir Makhija,1,"🌟 **Review of My Second Stay**

This was my *second visit* to the hotel — I’ve always liked the *location*, it’s convenient and peaceful.

I want to specially appreciate **Mr. Ajit Sharma**, the Restaurant Manager, for his *wonderful hospitality and warmth*. He genuinely cares for guests. What really impressed me was how he called me around *10:15 am*, reminding me that breakfast timing was till 10 am and invited me over anyway. Thanks to him, I enjoyed a *hot and fresh buffet* even till *10:30 am* — a gesture that will stay with me.

It was also good to see the *Managing Director visiting the property*, checking for shortcomings and guiding the staff. However, I believe it’s equally important to share *words of appreciation* with the team when they do well — it really boosts morale. Most importantly, when customers are around, management should *engage with them directly* — ask if everything is okay, if anything can be improved, and *welcome feedback with empathy*. That’s where the most valuable insights come from!

On the downside, my room experience wasn’t comfortable this time. The *AC wasn’t working*, and the *fan made a loud noise* the whole night. Though I was exhausted and managed to sleep, it was far from ideal. This aspect would make me think twice before planning my next stay.

I recently had the misfortune of staying at Hotel Sitara Paradise in Ameerpet, and I would strongly advise against it. Despite the online price range of ₹1800-₹2300, the front office staff refused to allow a 12:00 AM check-in, instead insisting on a direct booking for ₹2700/- for 24 hours.

The hotel's policy of not providing a 24-hour check-in and check-out facility is misleading, and the staff's behavior was unprofessional. The only redeeming quality was the breakfast, which was sourced from another hotel.

The AC room I booked had a non-functional AC, and the blanket provided was dirty, smelly, and infested with paddy bugs. The hotel's security was also a concern, as I witnessed staff and outsiders drinking in the reception hall late at night, making me and my wife feel uncomfortable and insecure.

Most of the rooms seemed to be designed like mini bars, which was not what I expected. Overall, my experience at Hotel Sitara Paradise was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone, especially families.",2025-04-01T10:42:18.222869Z,5 months ago

During my recent 15-day stay at Hotel Greenpark, Hyderabad, I had the privilege of meeting Sitamma, the TEAM LEAD assigned to our rooms.

Every day, without fanfare, Sitamma would ensure that everything was not just clean—but cared for.

Fresh linens, spotless spaces, thoughtful gestures for my family — all done with such quiet dedication that it felt less like service, and more like a mother looking after her home.

She never missed a detail.
She never needed to be reminded.
Her work spoke volumes about her pride, discipline, and genuine warmth.

In a world rushing for speed, Sitamma reminded me that care still has no shortcuts.
It’s in the small touches that true hospitality shines.

👏 A heartfelt thank you to Hotel Greenpark for nurturing such exceptional service culture.
From seamless logistics to smart service delivery, everything was designed for comfort—and executed with heart.

Good hotels provide convenience.

The staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and had everything I needed AC, TV, and free Wi-Fi. The free breakfast was nice. It was a nice place to stay and good for the price.",2025-05-08T13:22:28.872720Z,4 months ago
