The breakfast spread is very good with at least 3 live preparations. The lobby has a funky decoration of items from the film industry - cameras, posters etc which gives a good vibe. Playing board games or foosball with drinks from the bar gets you all relaxed.\nOnly challenge is the tight location where parking can be a challenge.\nOverall a fun place to relax and stay.",

The d\u00e9cor is very cool and gives off a great vibe, and the customer service was absolutely amazing. The staff were warm, friendly, and genuinely caring.\n\nThe location is a big plus, very central and convenient. It\u2019s easy to commute anywhere from there, and there are great shopping options nearby, including two shopping centres directly opposite the hotel and a large supermarket close by. That was definitely a highlight.\n\nHowever, there were a few downsides. The food was just okay. As someone who can get an upset stomach easily, especially while traveling, it was frustrating that there weren\u2019t any mild or comfort food options. Everything was quite oily spicy and full of masala. It would have been great to have simple choices like plain toast, potatoes, or other bland foods. The croissant I had was very oily and still managed to be dry.  Even the toast I requested took 15 minutes to arrive, which wasn\u2019t ideal when I wasn\u2019t feeling well.\n\nAlso, one small annoyance: there was a video advert playing on loop in the lift with a woman  and it became pretty irritating over time, it wasn\u2019t even a good advert.\n\nThat said, despite the food and that one annoying ad, I would return. The overall experience was good, and the location, vibe, and excellent service made up for the few drawbacks. Oooh and the BED was soooo good, it honestly felt like sleeping on a cloud.",

I then asked to speak with Manager to see if exception can be made. Duty Manager said to give Him \"2 mins\". He did not look into if exception can be made and was following up with booking company for full payment. After a long time i approached Manager for update and to my disappointment He was dealing with another enquiry and did not give any update to me before doing so.\n\nWhen I raised my disappointment I was met with arrogant, rude remarks such as I should not be blaming Hotel and this is fault of booking company.\n\nAbove is not the only instance of arrogant, rude response from staff, as another instance is when I was over charged for drinks.\n\nIn this instance I bought drinks under \"buy one get one free\" promotion. Advert clearly showed promotion is buy one get one free.\n\nWhen Bill came I saw I was charged for 2 drinks so buy one get one free was not applied.\n\nWhen raising to staff I received explanation that did not at all justify bill and I let them know that this is a clear case of false advertisement. In response, member of staff was rude & arrogant and let me know that in 6 years they have not received complaint regarding promotion. This is something I find very hard to believe given clear false advertisement.\n\nI sent written complaint to hotel to e-mail provided by staff on where to send written complaints. E-mail was sent on 23/08/2025 and I have never received response, despite sending follow up on 27/08/2025.\n\nDate today is 29/08/2025.",

There were no clear signs or verbal communication from the staff. My colleague took out a cigarette in the room, and within minutes hotel staff showed up and demanded \u20b95000 as a penalty. It felt like a trap \u2013 an unfair and aggressive way to extract money from guests.\n\nIf the hotel is scanning bags and checking guests physically at check-in, why not inform or remove prohibited items at that time? This would prevent such situations. But instead, it seems like a deliberate setup to charge hefty fines without giving guests a fair warning.\n\nThis was a very bad experience. I feel the hotel is taking advantage of guests under the pretext of policies that are not clearly communicated.\n\nPlease be very careful if you plan to stay here. Definitely not a guest-friendly approach, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.\n\nI initially thought what happened with me was an isolated incident, but after checking the reviews now, it\u2019s clear this hotel is consistently cheating and mistreating guests. Back-to-back negative feedbacks clearly show that most guests are being harassed and looted here.\n\nThe staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. Their behavior is arrogant, and instead of making guests feel welcome, they intimidate and threaten over petty issues just to extract money. In my case, they charged \u20b95000 forcibly without giving any prior information or warning \u2014 and now I see this is their regular trick with guests!\n\nThis place is a scam in the name of a hotel. Management is shamelessly ignoring repeated complaints. It\u2019s shocking how they\u2019re still allowed to operate!\n\nAvoid this place at all costs if you don\u2019t want to ruin your trip.

At the end while checkout no one even helped with the luggage  and no one came for the same. Gave the call and it was more than 25mi  we waited and yet didnt hear anything.\n\nThere was just a single table lamp kind in the bedroom and insufficent light even to read.",

While the staff have consistently been kind, polite, and eager to help, my overall experience with the room conditions and the way issues were handled by management has been frustrating and disappointing.\n\nThe air-conditioning in the living room was malfunctioning from early on. Despite numerous visits from the engineering team, the issue remained unresolved for over a month. It eventually required ceiling work, which forced me to vacate my room on extremely short notice\u2014with less than 12 hours to pack and move into a temporary room before work the next morning.\n\nThe room also suffered from water leakage during heavy rain due to poorly sealed windows.\n\nOther ongoing problems included an unstable dishwasher, frequent internet disconnections, and cockroaches spotted in the room on two separate occasions.\n\nDespite repeated and reasonable requests for a permanent room change, no alternative was offered for several weeks. When I was eventually informed via message that I would be moved to an \u201cequivalent or better accommodation,\u201d I was later told this had been a typing error and that I would need to return to my original room. This also happened on short notice\u2014right after I had returned from work\u2014without clear communication.\n\nThat same evening, I learned that my temporary room had already been promised to another guest, which explained the urgency with which I was being asked to vacate. This created unnecessary pressure on both myself and the other guest and led to a very uncomfortable situation. After a long and ultimately unproductive discussion with the management team, I moved back into my original room the following day\u2014only to discover that not all previously reported issues had been resolved.\n\nWhile the service staff have remained consistently courteous, the overall handling of these problems\u2014especially for a long-term guest\u2014did not meet the standards one expects from a hotel under the Taj brand. The lack of communication and accountability from management left a lasting impression of poor guest care.\n\nTo be clear: the service staff are lovely and well-intentioned. But the way room issues and guest concerns are managed is inefficient and poorly coordinated. For short-term stays, this may not be as noticeable\u2014but for long-term guests, it makes a significant difference.\n\nUntil there is a stronger level of accountability from the management team, I unfortunately cannot recommend this hotel to colleagues or friends seeking long-term accommodations in Mumbai.",

As we were both recovering from surgery, walking was difficult, but the incredible staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Their care, attentiveness, and willingness to assist made all the difference during our recovery.\n\nFrom housekeeping to the restaurant, catering, gym, spa, and swimming pool, every team member provided exceptional service. A special mention to Gauri, Pooja, Similda, and Satish, from the housekeeping department, whose kindness and attention to detail made our daily routines effortless. The hospitality of Hendrik, Gaurav, Vignesh, and Ashish, from catering, also stood out\u2014they were incredibly welcoming and always ensured we had everything we needed.\n\nWe would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the front desk and concierge staff\u2014Mayur, Shailesh, Pratiksha, Raya, Regina, Dipti, and Tina\u2014who were always warm, helpful, and accommodating. They made every request seamless and ensured our stay was hassle-free. The housekeeping team deserves special recognition for maintaining our space so beautifully and always going the extra mile to make us comfortable.\n\nThe gym staff, Sandeep, Lalit, and Nitin were fantastic in helping us navigate workouts suited to our recovery, always offering guidance and encouragement. Similarly, the swimming pool team, Sudhir, Atiq, Premnath and Rohidas ensured we could fully enjoy the pool facilities, assisting us whenever needed and making every visit effortless.\n\nThe security staff also deserve high praise for their courtesy and professionalism. They not only ensured a safe and secure environment but also facilitated our movement within the resort, making it easier for us to get around despite our mobility challenges. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist truly enhanced our experience.\n\nA special thank you to Ranjit and the whole gardening team whose dedication to maintaining the lush, serene surroundings made our time at the Taj even more enjoyable. Their beautifully kept gardens provided us with a peaceful retreat every day.\n\nThe facilities at the Taj Apartments are world-class. Despite our mobility limitations, the staff made sure we could fully enjoy the amenities, whether it was arranging assistance for the gym, spa, and pool or making dining effortless with impeccable restaurant and catering services. The level of care and consideration we received was truly remarkable.\n\nOverall, our experience was nothing short of extraordinary. This was made possible by the efforts and management of the management team, led by Mrs Indrani Gupta, assisted by Mr Sushant Chavan and all the other managers in the various departments mentioned above.  The warmth, dedication, and professionalism of the entire team turned what could have been a challenging period into a seamless and luxurious stay. We felt truly looked after, and for that, we are immensely grateful. Thank you, Taj, for your outstanding hospitality and care. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate to return!",

Rooms condition- all of us (4 persons) have got identical rooms and all we have got the same problem- dirty room. So bath space corners are black because of mold. Bed sheet was with a black spot. Walls are cracked on corners.\n2. Personnel- they are not as kind as they should be.\n3. Dining room- I\u2019ve been surprised that the offered water was taken from faucet and there is nothing to drink else. So if you want to drink something like juice or Cola you have to pay extra money for that option. And you might be liked it but I am not, concerning food. So if you think that you will get different kind of food.. your thinks will be vanished by first breakfast. You have two options: hot and real hot. When I eat that food, I feel like my stomach is too infected and I really need to kill all infections inside.. say: \u201cgood bye\u201d to your infections and enjoy visiting toilet on the next morning. Too hot for such morning\u2026\n4. When I open my window I have a real perfect option to see how all people on railway station (around of 15 meters distance) are looking to my naked body (leaving a part about other interesting things that they could see) after a shower\u2026 it\u2019s so incredible!\nNow we are coming out of this \u201cbeautiful\u201d hotel and we meet garbage station with plenty of garbage trucks around on hotel right side. It's making this hotel unbelievable. You can find a nice garbage river close to left side of hotel apartment as well. So I\u2019ve only one question\u2026 Why it\u2019s 4 stars? Who assigned it?

There is renovation activity going in the rooms and lift, which caused significant inconvenience. We asked to change our room to slightly bigger room on day 2 and they upgraded us stating that it is of the same price. That room was even more spacious except that the area above our room was under construction. After a while there was continuous drilling noise which was unbearable. We requested to stop the activity but the manager at reception simply said that \"we can not stop the construction\". We asked then change the room or refund the money as we were unable to stay. They agreed to change the room at different floor and told us that staff will clean the room in half an hour and then they will inform us to shift. No one came for the next 3-4 hours and the construction activity also stopped. Then around 4pm, we went to have food from outside and one member stayed back as he was having fever. The moment we stepped outside again the drilling noise started. The person who stayed back called at reception to stop it. But the manager did not listen and responded that you can change the room immediately if you want but noise will continue. We did not change the room but stayed outside of the hotel till the time construction was ON upto 8pm. I've stayed at lot of hotels in Mumbai and haven't seen this kind of treatment with guests. I also asked the manager to connect me with the management to that I can apprise them but he said they are not available. I recommend avoid staying at this hotel as they do not care about the guests. However, their room staff was polite and courteous. They also empathized but they were unable to take any decision.",

The spacious accommodations were impeccably clean and beautifully appointed, with comfortable furnishings and modern amenities.\nThe hotel's staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. From the moment I arrived, they went out of their way to ensure that my stay was as enjoyable as possible. The restaurant offered a delicious variety of dishes, catering to all tastes. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive, with a wide selection of fresh, high-quality items.\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's spa. The relaxing ambiance and skilled therapists provided the perfect opportunity to unwind and rejuvenate.

            "text": "Fantastic Stay \u2013 5 Stars!\n\nOur stay at Novotel Mumbai International Airport was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything exceeded expectations. The hotel is modern, clean, and beautifully designed, with stunning rooms and a wide variety of options in the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets.\n\nWe arrived at an awkward time 3 AM while check-in wasn\u2019t until 3 PM. Due to an error with Expedia, we were in a difficult situation, but the hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. A special mention to Mehul at the front desk, who was incredibly pleasant, helpful, and genuinely committed to resolving the issue, ensuring we didn\u2019t have to wait 12 hours.\n\nOnce we received our room, we were blown away by how fabulous and modern it was. The hotel\u2019s rooftop swimming pool was another highlight, offering a great place to unwind while enjoying the lively Mumbai atmosphere (complete with the city\u2019s signature beeping traffic sounds).\n\nThroughout our stay, we were continually met with exceptional hospitality. A heartfelt thank you to Deepika, who was extremely attentive and went out of her way to assist us even on her day off! Her dedication and kindness truly stood out.\n\nThe restaurant team was also amazing, from the ever-wonderful Imran, NG, Munish, Saloni, Jhanvi, Verandra, Sneha Rahul Tajas  Sandhya, Manish, Kavita, Lokesh, Ajit to Gaurav and the talented chefs Vaibhavi who\u2019s presentation is beautiful, Sudyaa, Shan, Youna and the entire team. The food was consistently delicious, fresh, and varied. We took a short trip to Agra and found ourselves missing the amazing team at Novotel!\n\nBefore our trip, I had extensively researched hotels and read countless reviews. Many places looked great online but were disappointing in reality. However, Novotel truly set the standard. In contrast, even the famous Taj Hotel didn\u2019t match up the bathrooms there looked more like a one-star setup you\u2019d find in a street restaurant!\n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Mumbai, I highly recommend Novotel Mumbai International Airport. It\u2019s in a prime location less than 10 minutes from the airport and about 20 minutes from other key areas. If you use Uber, transportation is affordable and convenient.\n\nWe will definitely be staying here again\u2014hopefully later this year!",

From the moment you step into the grand lobby, you are greeted with impeccable hospitality and a sense of opulence that permeates every corner of this remarkable hotel.\n\nThe rooms at the Ramada Plaza are nothing short of magnificent. Elegantly appointed and exuding a contemporary charm, each room offers breathtaking views of either the Arabian Sea or the city skyline. The plush bedding, modern amenities, and thoughtful touches ensure a truly indulgent stay.\n\nOne of the highlights of this hotel is its culinary offerings. Whether you're craving authentic Indian delicacies, international flavors, or refreshing cocktails, the diverse restaurants and bars cater to every palate. The breakfast buffet is a feast for the senses, featuring an array of delectable dishes to start your day on a delicious note.\n\nThe Ramada Plaza also boasts exceptional leisure facilities, including a sparkling swimming pool overlooking the sea, a well-equipped fitness center, and rejuvenating spa services. After a day of exploring the vibrant streets of Mumbai, there's no better way to unwind and relax.\n\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart, however, is its exceptional service. The staff go above and beyond to ensure that every guest's needs are met with warmth and efficiency. Whether it's arranging transportation, organizing sightseeing tours, or simply offering a friendly smile, their dedication to hospitality is unmatched. Special thanks to Surja Kumar, Dashrath & Yogesh for their exceptional hospitality. On my special request they have done some additional room decoration which was unexpected and surprisingly beautiful.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Palm Grove was nothing short of extraordinary. From the luxurious accommodations to the impeccable service, every aspect of my stay exceeded expectations. If you're looking for a five-star retreat in the heart of Mumbai, look no further than the Ramada Plaza. Highly recommended.",

The hotel staff was incredibly courteous and went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nFrom the moment I entered the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine willingness to assist. The staff members were extremely friendly, attentive, and always ready to offer their assistance. They were knowledgeable about the hotel's facilities and services, and provided excellent recommendations for local attractions and dining options.\n\nThe rooms at VITS Mumbai International Airport T2 were immaculate and well-maintained. The cleanliness and hygiene standards were top-notch, which is especially important during these times. The housekeeping staff did an exceptional job in keeping the rooms tidy and well-stocked with essential amenities. I truly appreciated the attention to detail and the efforts put into maintaining a high level of cleanliness throughout the hotel.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the breakfast buffet at the hotel. The variety and quality of options were truly impressive. From traditional Indian dishes to continental breakfast items, there was something to cater to every palate. The freshness and taste of the food were remarkable, and the staff in the restaurant were attentive, ensuring that all guests had a pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe amenities offered by the hotel were also commendable. The fitness center was well-equipped and allowed for a great workout, while the business center provided a conducive environment for work-related tasks. The hotel's proximity to the international airport was another advantage, making it extremely convenient for travelers.\n\nOverall, my stay at VITS Mumbai International Airport T2 hotel was nothing short of exceptional. The courteous staff, impeccably clean rooms, and delicious breakfast buffet made my experience truly memorable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumbai, whether it's for business or leisure. It's undoubtedly a fantastic choice for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.",

They shouldn\u2019t be charging more than 3k for a night and they have the audacity to charge 10k to provide a bed and no gym/spa/nice restaurants or anything!! Just go stay at the oberoi or trident (which is what we did)",
