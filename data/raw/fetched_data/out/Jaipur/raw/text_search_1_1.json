The lobby is so elegant and friendly looking, it immediately relaxes you.\n\nThe rooms were well-spacious, neat, and tidy, and all the minute details were well taken care of. The housekeeping staff did a great job in providing comfort and hygiene.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the hospitality of the staff. Every encounter whether it was from the front desk staff to restaurant service was friendly, attentive, and made me feel truly cared for. They were always willing to assist with a smile.\n\nThe cuisine was also a highlight. The spread during the buffet featured a range of dishes, both international and local, and every meal was fresh and delicious. Watching the sunset view from the rooftop in the evening is not to be missed , it provides an added special touch to the experience.\n\nOverall, Hilton Jaipur provides the ideal combination of luxury, comfort, and hospitality. It's not so much a hotel, but a home away from home. I would highly recommend it to any visitor to Jaipur, business or pleasure.",

            "text": "My stay at Jaipur Inn was one of the most memorable experiences I've had during my solo travels. The space was inviting, and the family that runs it was incredibly warm, helpful, friendly, and generous. I was around for almost two weeks and stayed in the lovely Treetop Room which was spacious, clean, and tucked away in just the right corner of the property.\n\nI was so glad to have chosen this place because it felt a lot less like a hotel and a lot more like staying with extended family. The food was simple, healthy and homely. The owner, Mr. Pushpendra, offered to take the guests on the most interesting, fun and offbeat morning walks which always ended with a belly full of some of Jaipur\u2019s best breakfast foods.\n\nDuring one of the morning walks, I even found myself at Govind Dev Ji's temple (which I probably wouldn't have visited otherwise, not being a particularly religious person), and ended up really enjoying the experience. On these walks, I also explored Smriti Van, Amber Fort, a couple of other temples, and wandered through the fascinating 'rastas' of old Jaipur in search of kachoris, dhoklas, barfis - and basically, all things great.\n\nJaipur Inn isn\u2019t just a place to stay- it\u2019s a way to experience Jaipur. You\u2019ll see the city through the eyes of those who truly adore it. If you\u2019re looking for an authentic, heartwarming, and joy-filled experience, this is that place. I went looking for a room, and found a second home and I am so grateful for it!",

The actual experience fell short of the promised image and information. Here are some issues we faced:\n\n1. *Unhygienic conditions*: The washroom lacked basic amenities like a bucket.\n2. *Poor ventilation*: The exhaust system was inadequate.\n3. *Cramped room*: The room space was insufficient.\n4. *Lack of service*: Staff didn't clear dirty plates.\n\nOverpriced\nConsidering the poor service and amenities, the rates were unjustifiably high. We wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, especially given the expensive tariffs.\n\nAdvice\nBased on our experience, we'd advise potential guests to explore alternative options that offer better value for money.",

One of the areas we absolutely loved was the pool area, which is very relaxing and complete with a seating space and a separate area for lounge chairs.\nThe service was absolutely impeccable! We were very well taken care of, and the staff was always around to ask us if we needed anything or make changes to accommodate all the guests. One thing that can be improved though is their buffet menu, which I felt was lacking variety. The breakfast buffet was nice, with ample choices of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

Room was specious, having double bed with sofa bed and centre table also. There was a balcony also with room and it was a roadside view. At Morning break fast was served, it was Poha, Butter toast with jam and coffee, taste was good and quality with quantity was satisfactory. One more thing i will like to mention that I ordered a water bottle seperayely and during check out I asked for its payment but they didn't charged money for the water bottle. Really i was soo impressed with the staff specially who was seating at the reception. I will strongly recommend to book this property everyone, it is close to the Jaipur railway station ( Approax 300-500  Meter) and I will like to come back for sure in my next trip.

The space was inviting, and the family that runs it was incredibly warm, helpful, friendly, and generous. I was around for almost two weeks and stayed in the lovely Treetop Room which was spacious, clean, and tucked away in just the right corner of the property.\n\nI was so glad to have chosen this place because it felt a lot less like a hotel and a lot more like staying with extended family. The food was simple, healthy and homely. The owner, Mr. Pushpendra, offered to take the guests on the most interesting, fun and offbeat morning walks which always ended with a belly full of some of Jaipur\u2019s best breakfast foods.\n\nDuring one of the morning walks, I even found myself at Govind Dev Ji's temple (which I probably wouldn't have visited otherwise, not being a particularly religious person), and ended up really enjoying the experience. On these walks, I also explored Smriti Van, Amber Fort, a couple of other temples, and wandered through the fascinating 'rastas' of old Jaipur in search of kachoris, dhoklas, barfis - and basically, all things great.\n\nJaipur Inn isn\u2019t just a place to stay- it\u2019s a way to experience Jaipur. You\u2019ll see the city through the eyes of those who truly adore it. If you\u2019re looking for an authentic, heartwarming, and joy-filled experience, this is that place. I went looking for a room, and found a second home and I am so grateful for it!",

                "text": "We stayed in the Inter-Continental Jaipur for 4 nights.\nThe hotel is modern and comfortable. Our room was   nice with the beautiful terrase, looking the swimming  pool. Everything was clean. We had the half-board terms. The dinner is served in the same restaurant as the breakfast. I think that almost for every european visitor is not easy to adapt indian gastronomic habbits.  Indians are mainly vegetarians and tend to eat very spicy food.

Everything was clean. We had the half-board terms. The dinner is served in the same restaurant as the breakfast. I think that almost for every european visitor is not easy to adapt indian gastronomic habbits.  Indians are mainly vegetarians and tend to eat very spicy food.

Here\u2019s my breakdown:\n\nPros:\n\nCozy & Clean Rooms: The room was well-maintained \u2014 clean, comfortable, and just the right size for a relaxing stay.\n\nSmooth Check-In: Despite arriving well before the official check-in time, the onboarding process was seamless and hassle-free, which was a big plus.\n\nPolite Staff: The staff was courteous and professional throughout our stay, which added to the overall pleasant atmosphere.\n\nShopper\u2019s Paradise: The location is excellent, especially for those who love to shop. There are plenty of shopping outlets and local markets nearby.\n\nValet Parking Available: The hotel offers valet parking service, which adds a nice touch of convenience for guests with vehicles.\n\nCaf\u00e9 Viva: The caf\u00e9 at the hotel (Caf\u00e9 Viva) serves good quality food at competitive prices, making meals convenient and enjoyable without breaking the bank.\n\nCons:\n\nHousekeeping Concerns: This was the most disappointing part of the stay. After room cleaning, we had to repeatedly remind the staff for a fresh towel set, and even then, the request was only partially fulfilled. Might\u2019ve been a one-off incident, but worth mentioning.\n\nParking Reality: Although valet is offered, there\u2019s no actual hotel-owned parking space. Our car ended up being parked on the main road, which felt a bit unsafe.\n\nChargeable Snacks Confusion: A little clarity around the in-room snacks would have helped. While we were informed that the bar items were chargeable, the snacks left on the table came across as complimentary \"welcome snacks\" \u2014 only to find out at checkout that they were chargeable too.\n\nNoise Disturbance: Some rooms are poorly soundproofed, and we experienced noticeable noise around midnight \u2014 possibly from the top-floor restro bar or somewhere outside. It wasn\u2019t unbearable, but definitely impacted sleep quality.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis hotel has quite a few positives going for it, especially in terms of comfort, location, food, and hospitality. However, attention to details like housekeeping and clearer communication would go a long way in elevating the guest experience. I wouldn\u2019t rule out staying here again, but would hope to see some improvements next time.",

From the moment we arrived until check-out, every interaction was handled with warmth, professionalism, and genuine hospitality that truly made us feel at home.\n\nWhat stood out was not just the quality of the facilities, but the seamless coordination and positive attitude of the entire team. Every staff member\u2014from valet and security, to reception, breakfast attendants, and housekeeping\u2014treated us with attentiveness and kindness. It always felt like everyone was not just doing their job, but actually cared about making our stay comfortable.\n\nA special mention goes to the management, especially Mr. Sunil. In our brief conversation, I was struck by the compassion he shows towards his team\u2014asking thoughtful questions, ensuring everyone was looked after, and by extension, making guests feel genuinely valued. The team is clearly empowered and trusted, handling requests confidently and promptly, with no unnecessary delays or back-and-forths for approvals. This culture of care and ownership radiates through every aspect of the guest experience.\n\nOur stay was truly comfortable in every way: our requests were handled smoothly, the hotel was impeccably maintained, and there was always thoughtful attention to detail. It\u2019s rare to find a property where the service matches the infrastructure so perfectly.\n\nAll in all, we couldn\u2019t have asked for a better vacation stay. Thanks to every team member who contributed to making our trip special. We\u2019re already looking forward to coming back and highly recommend Novotel Jaipur to anyone seeking a genuine and memorable hospitality experience.",

            "text": "Lords plaza Jaipur sets a benchmark for hospitality in this industry. We\u00a0absolutely loved our stay here. This was the best place to stay in order to explore Jaipur. It was far more than value for money in my opinion. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone staying in Jaipur for Business or Vacation!\n\nRoom & Premises:\nThe 5th floor Pavillion room was where we stayed and it was exquisite! The room was pretty spacious. It has a small protruding and curved sitting area with floor to ceiling glass and view to admire, comfortable enough for the two of us and we did spend a lot of time there peeking out at the views. We could spot Birla temple, Moti doongri fort, the tip of Albert hall museum and some mountains right from there. The traffic signal below kept us entertained as well. We were\u00a0provided with everything you would need in the room, fresh towels, toiletries, bath mat, tea/coffee cart with hot water kettle, mini refrigerator, working tv with all the channels, sufficient luggage racks and office desk. The bathroom was separated from the room with a glass barrier(with a curtain for optional privacy), it looked amazing! Even though the hotel is right on the main road, it was never noisy and we had a good night's sleep throughout our stay here.\n\nLocation:\nI would give this place full\u00a0points for location. Albert hall museum and Masala chowk food court , both of which are in Nehru park right in front of the hotel. Hawa mahal, Jantar mantar and Bapu Bazar are also walkable from here. Birla temple is also very near. Autos are available as soon as you get out since the hotel is on the main road so it was very convenient to explore the city from here. A lot of good cafes and restaurants are also nearby ( in C-scheme). It felt pretty safe since there is a traffic signal right below and it is on the main road so we could easily walk to our room at night from nehru park in the hustle bustle of traffic.\n\nFood:\nA good in-house restaurant goes such a long way in customer experience and these guys have nailed it! The coriander restaurant...so good! They had complimentary breakfast here which was such a good spread, I have rarely encountered such a variety of tasty spread elsewhere. Dinner was a chargeable buffet and ala-carte, frankly the dinner buffet was such a steal at the price that it was our preferred option every day. Food was delicious, so lip-smacking good. The service was fast as well. I highly recommend everyone to try this restaurant. They even provided us with on-the-house tea & coffee after our checkout while we waited in the restaurant for hours since we still had time to catch our train. They went out of their way to serve us and checked up on us, it melted my heart!\n\nHospitality & Staff:\nFrankly, in terms of hospitality this was the best hotel I have encountered in my life and that is saying something especially including my travel to 5* hotels internationally. The staff is so prompt, proactive, polite and professional. It makes me feel so proud that such hospitality exists in an Indian hotel. The entrance to the hotel is so well\u00a0designed, your cab would stop right in front, luggage was picked up by the door man promptly. The door man greeted us with a genuine smile every time we went in or out of the hotel. Checkin\u00a0was quick to our\u00a0Pavillion room, they even put our trolley bags in the\u00a0room on top of the luggage racks so it was convenient for us to open, so thoughtful! Our room was cleaned every single day, the towels were replaced daily, the\u00a0tea/coffee cart, toiletries\u00a0replenished daily, fresh water bottles provided daily. The long chats we could\u00a0easily have with the smiling and polite staff was so heartwarming. Their service was really beyond our expectations. Special mention for Mr. Beekam, and restaurant staff Shiv, Santosh and Pandey Ji who were so attentive, polite and kind to us. This place reminds me of what we used to stand for \"Atithi Devo Bhavah\". This is how I felt about the hospitality here, such warmth can be found only at Lords Plaza, Jaipur.",
