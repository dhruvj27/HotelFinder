Since liquor purchase in Gujarat requires a permit, the hotel assists guests by providing a letter which helps in obtaining a liquor permit easily.

The spa and fitness center are also top-notch, offering a relaxing escape after a long day.\n\nThe location is ideal for both business and leisure, with easy access to major areas of the city. Whether you're staying for a night or a week, Taj Skyline ensures you experience hospitality at its finest. Highly recommended!",

They are truly exceptional and are a great example of Indian hospitality.\n\nHowever the rooms and the general lack of up keeping is what let's the hotel down. The lower floor rooms are very dated and in need to maintenance. During the course of 3 days stay we changed 3 rooms due to problems in room cleanliness, ac issue, etc. Biggest concern is that the rooms in 9th floor all have ac condensation issues and you end up with wet and sticky floors all the time. The other issue around general cleanliness and maintenance is obvious- rooms have mould, chipped wooden fixtures, rusted door frames, etc. Even the lifts are outdated with broken/ rusted panel board.\nWhile these issues can easily be ignored in a 3 star or even 4 star hotel, this is not acceptable in a hotel advertising themselves as a 5 star. Additionally I have never seen a 5 star hotel that don't provide amenities like hair dryer as part of standard bathroom fixtures or have concierge or travel assistance services.\n\nOverall my stay was made memorable only by the service of staff and I am not impressed by hotel amenities in any way. Come up with expectation of a 4 star hotel and you will be satisfied.",

However, what truly stood out was the warm hospitality and professionalism of the staff, particularly the receptionist.\n\nThe receptionist was courteous, efficient, and went above and beyond to ensure my needs were met. Their friendly demeanor and willingness to help made my stay even more enjoyable.\n\nI would highly recommend Hotel Wyndham Shela Ahmedabad to anyone looking for a comfortable and memorable stay in Ahmedabad.\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\nThank you to the entire staff, especially the receptionist, for making my stay so special!",

While the hotel itself is undeniably beautiful\u2014with a stunning ambiance, well-maintained interiors, and potentially one of the best locations we\u2019ve visited\u2014our experience was unfortunately tarnished by the attitude and behavior of the front office staff.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the welcome lacked warmth or hospitality. We were especially disappointed with the conduct of Ms. Piya and the manager, Mr. Drishya. Instead of being accommodating and courteous, as one would expect at a luxury property, their tone was dismissive, unhelpful, and frankly, disrespectful. Basic courtesy and professionalism were completely missing, which left us feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout our short stay.\n\nWhen guests choose a premium hotel and pay a substantial amount, we expect not just good infrastructure, but a high standard of service and hospitality. A beautiful property alone does not define a good experience\u2014it is the people, the service, and the attention to guest comfort that truly make a stay memorable. Sadly, the staff we interacted with seemed to lack both the training and the attitude required to work in hospitality.\n\nI sincerely request the management team to take this feedback seriously. No matter how well-designed or luxurious a property may be, it loses its charm when the front office\u2014the first and last point of contact for guests\u2014fails to uphold basic standards of hospitality. With the right staff and guest service training, this property can truly live up to its potential.\n\nUntil then, I would not recommend this place, simply because no guest paying such a premium should have to tolerate being treated rudely.",

He was very accommodating in terms of adding a few items to the decor and menu. He listened and answered each question with great patience and attentiveness.\n\nThe entire staff was very cooperative, polite and treated the event as their own. Starting from Ashwainbhai, Chehraji, Vikrambhai, Razabhai, Wahidbhai and a few other people on the reception and in the valet team that I am forgetting. Each person had their complete attention on the nitty-gritty of the event. If something was amiss, they were eager to make it as per our request.\n\nOur photographer termed the decor as the backdrop of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. The ACs were fully working. The decor was done impeccably. On our request, they also included coloured rangolis near the entrance in addition to the flowers, diyas and brass divis on the entrance, foyer, hall and on the tables.\n\nWe hosted a sit-down dinner, which felt very intimate and beautiful in this space. The staff was very helpful in rearranging and removing some of the furniture as we had imagined our sit-down to be.\n\nAll the necessary items for the cake cutting were ready on an already decorated table. The cake was well stored in the fridge for a few hours. The music system was initially not working, but they made it work, and it was heard throughout the hall.\n\nThe food is as always amazing at the house of MG. We had an elaborate menu. One of the staff members also came in to recommend a few of the chutneys, which was a really nice personal touch. At the end of the event, when we were done dancing, they also offered tea and coffee refreshments which were not in the menu initially. The rotation drinks and starters were continuously rotated. Drinks were again offered at the end.\n\nHouse of MG is a very well-maintained property and I have seen renovations happening from time to time. It can feel like a more expensive option compared to the rest of the halls, but the charm and heritage of this place combined with their wholehearted service and attitude of giving fully is unmatched. Since it\u2019s all-inclusive, you won\u2019t have to worry about the decor, valet or food having to be arranged from different agencies.\n\nHighly recommended for your intimate events \ud83d\ude0a",

He was very accommodating in terms of adding a few items to the decor and menu. He listened and answered each question with great patience and attentiveness.\n\nThe entire staff was very cooperative, polite and treated the event as their own. Starting from Ashwainbhai, Chehraji, Vikrambhai, Razabhai, Wahidbhai and a few other people on the reception and in the valet team that I am forgetting. Each person had their complete attention on the nitty-gritty of the event. If something was amiss, they were eager to make it as per our request.\n\nOur photographer termed the decor as the backdrop of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. The ACs were fully working. The decor was done impeccably. On our request, they also included coloured rangolis near the entrance in addition to the flowers, diyas and brass divis on the entrance, foyer, hall and on the tables.\n\nWe hosted a sit-down dinner, which felt very intimate and beautiful in this space. The staff was very helpful in rearranging and removing some of the furniture as we had imagined our sit-down to be.\n\nAll the necessary items for the cake cutting were ready on an already decorated table. The cake was well stored in the fridge for a few hours. The music system was initially not working, but they made it work, and it was heard throughout the hall.\n\nThe food is as always amazing at the house of MG. We had an elaborate menu.

            "text": "Terrifying and Unresolved Incident \u2013 Felt Unsafe and Unsupported\n\nI booked a 4D3N stay at The Cama \u2013 A Sabarmati Riverfront Hotel from 4th August 2025. My experience started off normally, but what happened on my second day has left me deeply shaken and feeling unsafe.\n\nOn the morning of 5th August, after taking a shower in my bathroom, I looked at the mirror and saw a message appear: \u201cUpdesh \u2764\ufe0e Vani.\u201d This was extremely disturbing because no one at the hotel knows me as \u201cVani\u201d (my ID and booking name is Shivani), and the message looked like it was written by hand on the mirror. I immediately took a photo and informed the front desk.\n\nThe receptionist was polite and offered to change my room, which I appreciated, but the unease never left me. That night, I felt so anxious that I left to stay with a friend\u2019s family.\n\nThe next morning, I returned to the hotel to request CCTV footage of the 3rd floor outside my room (307) for the hours before my check-in and while I was out. Initially, the Front Office Manager seemed supportive, but after hours of waiting and being stalled, I was told they could not show me the footage due to \u201cpolicy.\u201d Eventually, the General Manager told me outright that they would not provide the footage and suggested I go to the police instead.\n\nFor a guest\u2019s safety concern of this magnitude, I expected the hotel to be transparent and cooperative. Instead, I faced delays, avoidance, and a complete lack of accountability. There was no explanation for how that writing appeared on my mirror or whether someone had entered my room.\n\nIf you value your safety, privacy, and peace of mind, I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel.",

The bed was extremely comfortable, and the linens felt high-quality. We especially liked the thoughtful touches, such as a well-stocked minibar, ample closet space, and a cozy seating area. The bathroom was spacious and featured both a rain shower and premium toiletries, which added a nice touch of luxury.\n\nThe hotel offers a great range of amenities. The on-site restaurant served a delicious breakfast buffet each morning, with plenty of variety to suit all tastes. We also dined there in the evening, and the food was flavorful and beautifully presented. The gym was well-equipped, clean, and quiet\u2014perfect for a quick workout.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the excellent service.

The bed was super cozy, and the high-quality linens added to the overall luxury. I really appreciated the quietness of the room, which made it easy to relax and unwind after a long day.\nThe hotel had everything I needed. The gym was well-equipped, and the spa was the perfect place to de-stress. The swimming pool area was serene and well-maintained, offering a great spot to just relax. I also loved how eco-friendly the hotel is, which is a nice touch without compromising on comfort.\nThe dining experience was one of the highlights. The variety of food, from local Gujarati dishes to international cuisines, was impressive. Every meal I had was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The breakfast buffet especially stood out with its wide selection\u2014I found myself looking forward to it every morning!\nThe staff at ITC Narmada were incredibly courteous and attentive.

From the moment I stepped into the lobby until the time I reluctantly checked out, every aspect of my stay was truly exceptional.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by the most welcoming and attentive staff I've ever encountered. Their genuine smiles and eagerness to assist immediately made me feel like an honored guest. The check-in process was seamless, and I was escorted to my room, where I was left in awe of the opulent decor and impeccable cleanliness.\n\nThe room itself was a haven of comfort and sophistication. The attention to detail in the furnishings and amenities was remarkable. The plush bedding, tasteful decor, and state-of-the-art technology combined to create a space that was both inviting and functional. I particularly appreciated the stunning view from my room, which added an extra layer of enchantment to my stay.\n\nThroughout my visit, the hotel's staff continued to shine. They were always on hand to offer assistance, provide recommendations, or simply engage in friendly conversation. It's evident that the entire team takes great pride in ensuring guests feel not just accommodated, but genuinely cared for.\n\nIn summary, my stay at  Vivanta, Ahmedabad was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of opulence and warmth, delivered by the outstanding staff, made me feel like royalty. It's rare to find a five-star hotel that not only exceeds in luxury but also excels in making guests feel genuinely welcome and cherished.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend  Vivanta, Ahmedabad to anyone seeking an unforgettable and heartwarming five-star hotel experience. I can't wait for the opportunity to return and relive the magic of this extraordinary establishment. Thank you,  Vivanta, Ahmedabad , for making my stay a truly memorable one!",

The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and they went out of their way to make sure that I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\nMy room was spacious and beautifully decorated. It had everything I needed, including a comfortable bed, a luxurious bathroom, and a stunning view of the city. I also loved the fact that the room was very quiet, which made it easy to relax and get a good night's sleep.\n\nThe Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad has a variety of amenities to offer its guests, including a rooftop infinity pool, a spa, and a fitness center. I took advantage of the rooftop pool on several occasions, and it was the perfect place to cool off and relax after a long day. The spa was also excellent, and I highly recommend the signature massage.\n\nThe food at the Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad is also top-notch. I had the opportunity to dine at both of the hotel's restaurants, and I was impressed with both. The food was delicious, and the service was impeccable. I especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a wide variety of options to choose from.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing stay at the Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad. It is a truly luxurious hotel with excellent amenities and staff. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Ahmedabad.",

Instead of being accommodating and courteous, as one would expect at a luxury property, their tone was dismissive, unhelpful, and frankly, disrespectful. Basic courtesy and professionalism were completely missing, which left us feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout our short stay.\n\nWhen guests choose a premium hotel and pay a substantial amount, we expect not just good infrastructure, but a high standard of service and hospitality.

The hotel provided a comfortable and memorable stay, and here's my review based on various aspects:  Special thanks to the GM Vinod Kumar and his staff.\n\nLocation: The hotel is conveniently situated in a prime location, making it easily accessible from major attractions and transportation hubs in Amdavad.  Easy for Uber and Ola.  Whether you're a leisure or business traveler, you'll appreciate the hotel's proximity to key areas of interest.\n\nAccommodation: The rooms at were spacious, clean, and well-appointed. I particularly enjoyed the comfortable bed and the modern amenities available. And even though close to the main road, it was very quiet.\n\nStaff: The hotel staff demonstrated exceptional professionalism and hospitality throughout my stay. They were friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, the staff ensured a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making me feel valued as a guest. I felt very safe and secure, thanks Nipurn.\n\nDining: The dining options at are impressive. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which featured a wide array of delicious traditional Gujrati dishes: khandvi, dhokla, khaman, jalebi, and many more.  The quality of the food was excellent, and the service was prompt and attentive.  Thanks Utkarsh, Manoj and Payal.  The chef was awesome!\n\nAdditionally, the hotel offered meeting and event spaces, making it an ideal choice for business travelers or those hosting events in Ahmedabad.\nIn conclusion, the Four Points in Ahmedabad is a top-notch hotel that offers a fantastic stay. From its convenient location to its comfortable rooms and exceptional service, the hotel excelled in providing a memorable experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Ahmedabad, whether for business or leisure purposes.",

If you are traveling with a patient, they can prepare a room with surgical beds, wheelchair etc. What a great gesture!\n\nThe hotel has a cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, Gujarati thali restaurant, banquet hall, swimming pool, fitness center etc. Their cafe Fresh Roast is popular with the locals. Food and service was excellent throughout our stay. The buffet breakfast is excellent with local Gujrati foods like Thepla, Khakra, Dhokla and popular breakfast foods like Idli, Poha, Baked Beans, Toast, Cereal, Dosa and Omelette.\n\nThe hotel offers free WIFI which works very well.\n\nMy favorite part about the hotel is how the decor has been done using preserved family heirlooms along with modern features and amenities.We took time to explore the vintage family furniture and other items placed tastefully in different corners on the hotel property. The walls are filled with family photos and pictures of distinguished guests who have stayed here. I met the owners of the hotel and their love and pride in their family home and hospitality towards hotel guests is remarkable.\n\nIf you enjoy staying in unique properties, then you will love this offbeat stay in Mani Mansion.\n\nP.
