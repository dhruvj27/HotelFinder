Traveling from London, we were looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming hotel\u2014and Nalanda went above and beyond our expectations.\n\nThe hotel offered an exceptional breakfast experience every morning, with a wide variety of both Indian and English options, all fresh and delicious. The hot breakfast was particularly impressive, with great attention to quality and presentation. It was clear the kitchen team takes pride in their work.\n\nWe also had regular dinners at the in-house restaurant, Spice Village, which deserves special mention. Every meal we had there was excellent\u2014delicious food, a rich and varied menu, clean and pleasant ambiance, and attentive staff. It became our go-to place every evening.\n\nThe hotel staff, across all departments, showed great professionalism and warmth. The reception team on every shift\u2014morning, afternoon, and night\u2014was exceptionally helpful and polite. They were always ready to assist, whether it was with local guidance, housekeeping needs, or arranging transport. Housekeeping was efficient and kept our room clean, fresh, and well-stocked every day.\n\nOne thing I deeply appreciated was the presence of the hotel\u2019s owner. Every time he visited the hotel, he would greet us with a genuine smile and respectful eye contact. That personal touch made a big difference and reflected the caring culture of the hotel.\n\nThe location of the hotel is also excellent\u2014peaceful, yet centrally located with easy access to shopping areas, eateries, and cultural spots. The overall cleanliness of the hotel, the comfort of the rooms, and the consistent quality of service made our long stay truly enjoyable.\n\nTo sum up, Nalanda Hotel offers everything a guest could ask for\u2014comfort, cleanliness, delicious food, friendly service, and a sense of being truly welcomed. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ahmedabad, whether for business or leisure.\n\nThank you, Nalanda Hotel, for making our stay so memorable.\n\nI will definitely be visiting again later this year and am already looking forward to another great stay.\n\nWarm regards,\nGirish Multani\n(London, UK)",

We were especially disappointed with the conduct of Ms. Piya and the manager, Mr. Drishya. Instead of being accommodating and courteous, as one would expect at a luxury property, their tone was dismissive, unhelpful, and frankly, disrespectful. Basic courtesy and professionalism were completely missing, which left us feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout our short stay.\n\nWhen guests choose a premium hotel and pay a substantial amount, we expect not just good infrastructure, but a high standard of service and hospitality.

Don't know what it takes 1:30 hrs to make just a roti , sabji and dal .\n\nIn 2 days our room key was disabled thrice. So we cannot use the lift and also go to our room.  When I asked the receptionist she said you have your phone with you that's why it is happening like this. The second time after coming from the swimming pool the same happened. When I had nothing with me.\n\nBeware they are speaking sugary but nothing in their services.\n\nThey will try to sell rooms of the upper category saying all 50-60 deluxe rooms are booked..which is not possible except there is a function.\n\nThe road outside the club is pathetic. Full of pot holes, gutter water .  During rainy season it's big No.\n\nOverall the experience was not at all good.\n\nIf you want to just stay without any food inclusion in the package then have it as a low cost option .

They also accept foreign passports (surprisingly many other hotels in Gujarat don\u2019t). We were greeted by a nice gentleman who helped us with our bags. The room was very fresh and clean, the bed and bathroom were also nice and clean. The room had air conditioning and a decent view of the street and surrounding buildings.\n\nThe staff in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful. The food was some of the best I have had during my whole time in Gujarat. I recommend you check out the restaurant if you stay here (they also offer room service).\n\nWhen we had our room cleaned it was a quick but thorough job, they made our bed and cleaned the floor too which was great.\n\nThis place is walking distance from the riverfront which is a decent spot for a walk if you want to avoid the crazy traffic on the roads and the western side of the riverfront walk is mostly shaded in the late afternoon.\n\nOverall it has been a great stay and I found the price very reasonable especially considering the quality of the place.\nIf you are coming to Ahmedabad this is a great place to stay with amazing food.",

            "text": "Lotus Park Hotel, located just 15 minutes away from the main railway station in Ahmedabad, is a great choice for travelers looking for budget-friendly yet comfortable accommodation. The hotel is situated atop a shopping complex, making it easily accessible and well-connected. One of the best features of this location is the BRTS bus stop right in front of the hotel, offering convenient transportation options. Additionally, popular spots like the Riverfront are just 5 minutes away, making it a prime spot for those who want to explore the city.\n\nThe hotel building is aesthetically pleasing, with a modern design that stands out. The reception area, located on the 2nd floor, is spacious and welcoming. It has a number of sofas where you can relax while the check-in process is completed. The process itself was fairly quick, though there was a slight hiccup when I was assigned the wrong room. Despite having booked a premium room, I was initially given a deluxe one. Rather than acknowledging the mistake, the hotel staff insisted that the deluxe room was the premium one. Thankfully, my friend had already seen all the room categories, and we were able to sort it out. After the issue was resolved, I was pleased to find the room to be clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The bathroom was neat, with all necessary toiletries, and there was hot water available whenever needed. The tea and coffee maker in the room was a nice touch for a quick refreshment.\n\nThe room itself had a comfortable bed with soft mattresses, perfect for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. The ambient lighting created a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The breakfast spread, while not extensive, was adequate for a budget hotel. It included a selection of continental dishes like poori sabji, Idli, Uttapam, khakhra, along with fresh cut fruits, juices, and bread with butter and jam. While the spread wasn\u2019t lavish, the taste of the food was perfectly on point and satisfying.\n\nOne of the highlights of the hotel is the terrace, which offers a stunning panoramic view of the city. It\u2019s a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The terrace also has a small party hall that is great for intimate gatherings or small events like engagement ceremonies.\n\nOverall, Lotus Park Hotel is a solid choice for those seeking a clean, budget-friendly place to stay in Ahmedabad. The rooms are comfortable, the food is good, and the service is friendly. While the initial mix-up with the room allocation was frustrating, the rest of the stay was pleasant. The hotel\u2019s location is another major plus, with easy access to public transportation and popular tourist spots nearby. If you\u2019re traveling on a budget but want a comfortable place to stay with great connectivity, Lotus Park Hotel is definitely worth considering.",

                "text": "Lotus Park Hotel, located just 15 minutes away from the main railway station in Ahmedabad, is a great choice for travelers looking for budget-friendly yet comfortable accommodation. The hotel is situated atop a shopping complex, making it easily accessible and well-connected. One of the best features of this location is the BRTS bus stop right in front of the hotel, offering convenient transportation options. Additionally, popular spots like the Riverfront are just 5 minutes away, making it a prime spot for those who want to explore the city.\n\nThe hotel building is aesthetically pleasing, with a modern design that stands out. The reception area, located on the 2nd floor, is spacious and welcoming. It has a number of sofas where you can relax while the check-in process is completed. The process itself was fairly quick, though there was a slight hiccup when I was assigned the wrong room. Despite having booked a premium room, I was initially given a deluxe one. Rather than acknowledging the mistake, the hotel staff insisted that the deluxe room was the premium one. Thankfully, my friend had already seen all the room categories, and we were able to sort it out. After the issue was resolved, I was pleased to find the room to be clean, comfortable, and well-maintained. The bathroom was neat, with all necessary toiletries, and there was hot water available whenever needed. The tea and coffee maker in the room was a nice touch for a quick refreshment.\n\nThe room itself had a comfortable bed with soft mattresses, perfect for a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. The ambient lighting created a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The breakfast spread, while not extensive, was adequate for a budget hotel. It included a selection of continental dishes like poori sabji, Idli, Uttapam, khakhra, along with fresh cut fruits, juices, and bread with butter and jam. While the spread wasn\u2019t lavish, the taste of the food was perfectly on point and satisfying.\n\nOne of the highlights of the hotel is the terrace, which offers a stunning panoramic view of the city. It\u2019s a peaceful place to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The terrace also has a small party hall that is great for intimate gatherings or small events like engagement ceremonies.\n\nOverall, Lotus Park Hotel is a solid choice for those seeking a clean, budget-friendly place to stay in Ahmedabad. The rooms are comfortable, the food is good, and the service is friendly. While the initial mix-up with the room allocation was frustrating, the rest of the stay was pleasant. The hotel\u2019s location is another major plus, with easy access to public transportation and popular tourist spots nearby. If you\u2019re traveling on a budget but want a comfortable place to stay with great connectivity, Lotus Park Hotel is definitely worth considering.",

The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and they went out of their way to make sure that I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\nMy room was spacious and beautifully decorated. It had everything I needed, including a comfortable bed, a luxurious bathroom, and a stunning view of the city. I also loved the fact that the room was very quiet, which made it easy to relax and get a good night's sleep.\n\nThe Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad has a variety of amenities to offer its guests, including a rooftop infinity pool, a spa, and a fitness center. I took advantage of the rooftop pool on several occasions, and it was the perfect place to cool off and relax after a long day. The spa was also excellent, and I highly recommend the signature massage.\n\nThe food at the Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad is also top-notch. I had the opportunity to dine at both of the hotel's restaurants, and I was impressed with both. The food was delicious, and the service was impeccable. I especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a wide variety of options to choose from.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing stay at the Renaissance Hotel Ahmedabad. It is a truly luxurious hotel with excellent amenities and staff. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Ahmedabad.",

Traveling from London, we were looking for a clean, comfortable, and welcoming hotel\u2014and Nalanda went above and beyond our expectations.\n\nThe hotel offered an exceptional breakfast experience every morning, with a wide variety of both Indian and English options, all fresh and delicious. The hot breakfast was particularly impressive, with great attention to quality and presentation. It was clear the kitchen team takes pride in their work.\n\nWe also had regular dinners at the in-house restaurant, Spice Village, which deserves special mention. Every meal we had there was excellent\u2014delicious food, a rich and varied menu, clean and pleasant ambiance, and attentive staff. It became our go-to place every evening.\n\nThe hotel staff, across all departments, showed great professionalism and warmth. The reception team on every shift\u2014morning, afternoon, and night\u2014was exceptionally helpful and polite. They were always ready to assist, whether it was with local guidance, housekeeping needs, or arranging transport. Housekeeping was efficient and kept our room clean, fresh, and well-stocked every day.\n\nOne thing I deeply appreciated was the presence of the hotel\u2019s owner. Every time he visited the hotel, he would greet us with a genuine smile and respectful eye contact. That personal touch made a big difference and reflected the caring culture of the hotel.\n\nThe location of the hotel is also excellent\u2014peaceful, yet centrally located with easy access to shopping areas, eateries, and cultural spots. The overall cleanliness of the hotel, the comfort of the rooms, and the consistent quality of service made our long stay truly enjoyable.\n\nTo sum up, Nalanda Hotel offers everything a guest could ask for\u2014comfort, cleanliness, delicious food, friendly service, and a sense of being truly welcomed. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Ahmedabad, whether for business or leisure.\n\nThank you, Nalanda Hotel, for making our stay so memorable.\n\nI will definitely be visiting again later this year and am already looking forward to another great stay.\n\nWarm regards,\nGirish Multani\n(London, UK)",

From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality, making us feel at home instantly. The hotel is a perfect blend of comfort, elegance, and exceptional service, and we couldn\u2019t have asked for more during our stay.\n\nA special mention must go to Aakash, the manager, who went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was perfect. His attention to detail and genuine care for his guests made all the difference. Whether it was recommending local spots to explore, or simply checking in to see if we were comfortable, Aakash truly made us feel like family. His kindness and dedication left a lasting impression on us, and it's rare to come across someone who takes such pride in their work.\n\nThe rooms were spotless, the food was delicious, and every corner of the hotel reflected their commitment to excellence. The staff as a whole were attentive and responsive, but it was Aakash\u2019s personal touch that made this stay unforgettable.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in Ahmedabad, CITY INN is more than just a place to stay\u2014it\u2019s a place where you\u2019ll feel truly cared for.

From the moment I stepped into the lobby until the time I reluctantly checked out, every aspect of my stay was truly exceptional.\n\nUpon arrival, I was greeted by the most welcoming and attentive staff I've ever encountered. Their genuine smiles and eagerness to assist immediately made me feel like an honored guest. The check-in process was seamless, and I was escorted to my room, where I was left in awe of the opulent decor and impeccable cleanliness.\n\nThe room itself was a haven of comfort and sophistication. The attention to detail in the furnishings and amenities was remarkable. The plush bedding, tasteful decor, and state-of-the-art technology combined to create a space that was both inviting and functional. I particularly appreciated the stunning view from my room, which added an extra layer of enchantment to my stay.\n\nThroughout my visit, the hotel's staff continued to shine. They were always on hand to offer assistance, provide recommendations, or simply engage in friendly conversation. It's evident that the entire team takes great pride in ensuring guests feel not just accommodated, but genuinely cared for.\n\nIn summary, my stay at  Vivanta, Ahmedabad was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of opulence and warmth, delivered by the outstanding staff, made me feel like royalty. It's rare to find a five-star hotel that not only exceeds in luxury but also excels in making guests feel genuinely welcome and cherished.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend  Vivanta, Ahmedabad to anyone seeking an unforgettable and heartwarming five-star hotel experience. I can't wait for the opportunity to return and relive the magic of this extraordinary establishment. Thank you,  Vivanta, Ahmedabad , for making my stay a truly memorable one!",

While the hotel itself is undeniably beautiful\u2014with a stunning ambiance, well-maintained interiors, and potentially one of the best locations we\u2019ve visited\u2014our experience was unfortunately tarnished by the attitude and behavior of the front office staff.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the welcome lacked warmth or hospitality. We were especially disappointed with the conduct of Ms. Piya and the manager, Mr. Drishya. Instead of being accommodating and courteous, as one would expect at a luxury property, their tone was dismissive, unhelpful, and frankly, disrespectful. Basic courtesy and professionalism were completely missing, which left us feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable throughout our short stay.\n\nWhen guests choose a premium hotel and pay a substantial amount, we expect not just good infrastructure, but a high standard of service and hospitality. A beautiful property alone does not define a good experience\u2014it is the people, the service, and the attention to guest comfort that truly make a stay memorable. Sadly, the staff we interacted with seemed to lack both the training and the attitude required to work in hospitality.\n\nI sincerely request the management team to take this feedback seriously. No matter how well-designed or luxurious a property may be, it loses its charm when the front office\u2014the first and last point of contact for guests\u2014fails to uphold basic standards of hospitality. With the right staff and guest service training, this property can truly live up to its potential.\n\nUntil then, I would not recommend this place, simply because no guest paying such a premium should have to tolerate being treated rudely.",
