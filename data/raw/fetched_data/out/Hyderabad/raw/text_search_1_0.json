Zero sense of hospitality.\n\nHonestly, the whole place reeks of negligence. It\u2019s the kind of hotel that makes you want to shower twice after checking out\u2014once to wash off the filth, and once to wash off the regret of booking it in the first place.\n\nThis stay wasn\u2019t just bad. It was a waste of money, time, and sanity. If you\u2019re even thinking about staying here, DON\u2019T. Save your money and your soul. You\u2019ve been warned.",

For a room tariff of Rs. 7500 per night, I expected a much higher standard in terms of both service and facilities. Unfortunately, the hotel didn\u2019t live up to that expectation.\n\nThe room, while decently sized, lacked attention to detail. The cleanliness wasn\u2019t up to the mark, the linens felt worn out, and the bathroom amenities were basic at best. There was a sense that the space hadn\u2019t been refreshed or maintained well, which was disappointing given the premium pricing.\n\nOverall, the stay didn\u2019t feel like it offered good value for money. With just a bit more care and improvement in upkeep, it could be a decent option, but as it stands, I wouldn\u2019t choose to stay here again unless significant changes are made.",

For a room tariff of Rs. 7500 per night, I expected a much higher standard in terms of both service and facilities. Unfortunately, the hotel didn\u2019t live up to that expectation.\n\nThe room, while decently sized, lacked attention to detail. The cleanliness wasn\u2019t up to the mark, the linens felt worn out, and the bathroom amenities were basic at best. There was a sense that the space hadn\u2019t been refreshed or maintained well, which was disappointing given the premium pricing.\n\nOverall, the stay didn\u2019t feel like it offered good value for money. With just a bit more care and improvement in upkeep, it could be a decent option, but as it stands, I wouldn\u2019t choose to stay here again unless significant changes are made.",

The resort is impeccably clean and well-maintained, with a strong focus on hygiene that was noticeable from the moment we arrived. The sheer amount of space is a huge plus, with beautiful parks and grounds that are perfect for leisurely strolls.\nThe accommodations were great. Our room was very spacious, and the room service was prompt and efficient. The washrooms, in particular, were the best I've seen at a resort\u2014spotless and well-designed.\nHowever, the food was a major disappointment and the one significant drawback of our stay. It was a complete letdown. There was a noticeable lack of variety, and what was available simply didn't have any flavor. Considering the high quality of everything else, the food was a shocking and frustrating experience. It really wasn't worth the price and left us feeling quite let down.",

The swimming pool is placed right next to the dining area, which makes swimming uncomfortable and also raises concerns about diners accidentally dropping things into the pool. My room had a bathtub with no proper drainage, so water spilled into the room. The only good part was the cleaning staff on the 8th floor who kept cleaning up the mess \u2013 though it clearly seemed like a daily extra burden for them due to poor planning.\n\nThe passages were dimly lit, there was no proper gym, and the balcony had no view. While some of the 3rd-floor staff were decent, the bar staff mocked customer choices \u2013 something I\u2019d never expect in a 5-star hotel. The overall vibe felt more like a casual hangout spot rather than a premium hospitality experience.\n\nNot the luxury stay I had hoped for. Management really needs to address these issues.",

My husband complained about a hair in the stir-fried veggies; instead of replacing the dish, the staff merely removed the hair and brought back the same plate. Their service became pathetic when a sudden rush arrived at the restaurant. The staff stopped paying attention to our needs, as they were fully focused on a celebrity who had arrived at the same time. Apart from the food experience, the room service was pathetic too. We called the staff to get the asset locker fixed, but their technician arrived an hour later, only after we had repeatedly called to remind them. After that, the technician took another half an hour to fix it. We were in a hurry to explore the city but got delayed because of their pathetic service.",

When I tried them, the quality was extremely poor \u2014 the manufacturing year was shown as 2024. Even after informing the team, I am not sure what action they intend to take.\n\nOn top of that, I still haven\u2019t received my invoice, and the person assisting me seemed least bothered to even ask about it.\n\nI really did not expect this kind of experience from such a reputed hotel.\n\nI am also attaching a picture of the snacks I tried (just one piece) and returned immediately.",

The location is a big plus , almost everything important is within 15\u201320 minutes: Hitech City, railway station, Toli Chowki, Charminar, etc. The area around the hotel is vibrant, surrounded by sweet shops, dosa/idli vendors, pan stalls, Masqati dairy, Chinese joints, Paradise, Shah Ghouse, and other major restaurants.\n\nA huge bonus was that Hussain Sagar Lake is just a 15-minute walk from the hotel, right next to the new Secretariat. We strolled there every night, very peaceful and enjoyable. You can also take a Rapido auto for around \u20b950 if you don\u2019t feel like walking.\n\nThe staff was absolutely amazing.  Noor and Dinesh were super helpful and always available.  Special thanks to Safeera and her colleague from housekeeping \u2013 they were so friendly with our kids, letting them play in the hallway without any complaints and even joining in sometimes. It made a big difference, especially during long days indoors. The two cleaning ladies were also wonderful, kept our room spotless every day and stayed in touch with my wife and kids with warm, friendly conversations.\n\nThe housekeeping, room service, and front desk teams were all top-notch. There is a 24/7 front desk, and security was always present. The lift is a little old-school, but it works fine. Rooms are decent-sized and comfortable for the price.\n\nOnly Downside: the restaurant, which is managed separately, had a few staff members and a manager who weren\u2019t very hospitable, rude over small things like asking for an extra plate/bowls.  But the hotel staff more than made up for that experience.\n\nOverall, this was a very family-friendly stay, and we made some great memories here. Will definitely be coming back. For any reservations or hotel-related issues help, reach out to Vikrant , he is your guy, super helpful and responsive.",

Located near Hussain Sagar Lake, it offers a blend of old-world charm and modern amenities. The architecture, with its turrets and stone walls, creates a fairy-tale-like ambiance. Rooms are cozy and designed with a classic touch, while the rooftop pool and in-house dining options enhance the guest experience.\n\nWhile the aesthetic is captivating, the hotel\u2019s upkeep and service have received mixed reviews. Some guests appreciate its central location and themed design, while others note the need for better maintenance and improved customer service. It's an ideal choice for those looking for a visually striking hotel with a medieval theme, but setting realistic expectations about service quality is advised.",

Let me share my experience with you:\n\nAmbiance: From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was enveloped in an ethereal ambiance. Soft lighting, soothing colors, and carefully curated decor set the tone for a tranquil retreat. The lobby\u2019s lush indoor plants added a touch of nature, instantly calming my senses.\n\nRooms: The well-furnished rooms were a sanctuary of comfort. Plush beds with crisp linens, tasteful artwork, and thoughtfully placed accent pieces created an inviting space. The large windows framed picturesque views of the city skyline, allowing natural light to flood the room during the day.\n\nAesthetic Vibes: Each room had its unique charm\u2014a blend of modern elegance and cozy warmth. The minimalist design, combined with subtle pops of color, evoked a sense of serenity. I found myself appreciating the attention to detail\u2014the textured wallpaper, the vintage-style lamps, and the locally crafted wooden furniture.\n\nBathroom Delight: The ensuite bathroom was equally delightful. Clean lines, gleaming tiles, and a rain shower made me feel pampered. The eco-friendly toiletries were a thoughtful touch, aligning perfectly with the hotel\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\n\nCommon Areas: The Heartfelt Inn\u2019s common areas were an extension of its aesthetic allure. The rooftop garden, adorned with fairy lights, offered a magical spot for stargazing. And the cozy library corner\u2014complete with plush armchairs and a crackling fireplace\u2014beckoned bookworms like me.\n\nService: The staff\u2019s warm hospitality added to the overall experience. They anticipated my needs, whether it was a late-night cup of chamomile tea or arranging a taxi for my city exploration.\n\nIn summary, the Heartfelt Inn is more than just a place to rest\u2014it\u2019s an oasis of beauty and tranquility. Whether you\u2019re a solo traveler seeking solitude or a couple celebrating a special occasion, this 3-star gem will leave you with cherished memories.",

            "text": "1.\u00a0 Location: The Hyderabad Marriott Hotel is located in a prime area, right by the Hussain Sagar Lake, offering beautiful views of the water and the city. It's well connected to popular attractions, business districts, and major landmarks, making it convenient for both leisure and business travelers.\n\n2.\u00a0 Check-in Experience: The check-in process was smooth and efficient. The staff at the front desk were welcoming and professional.\n\n3.\u00a0 Room: The room was spacious, clean, and well-maintained. The bed was incredibly comfortable, offering a restful sleep after a long day. The d\u00e9cor was modern yet cozy, with all the amenities one would expect from a five-star hotel, including a minibar, flat-screen TV, and a work desk.\n\n4. Dining: We had the opportunity to dine at their in-house Okra restaurant, and the food was excellent. The breakfast buffet was lavish, offering a wide variety of cuisines, including Indian, Continental, and Asian options. The live cooking stations were a nice touch, and the staff was attentive to dietary preferences.\nSpecial thanks to Sara for serving us with utmost hospitality. As tea enthusiasts, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of Masala tea. For dinner we tried Chicken Rogan Josh, it was very delicious. Its a highly recommended dish.\n\n5. Service: The service throughout the hotel was top-notch. The staff were courteous, helpful, and always willing to go the extra mile. Whether it was housekeeping, restaurant staff (specially Sara), or concierge, everyone ensured our stay was comfortable.\n\n6. Value for Money: While the hotel is on the pricier side, the level of service, luxury, and comfort offered makes it worth the cost. It is a great option for those looking to splurge a little for a premium experience in Hyderabad.\n\nOverall Experience: Our stay at Hyderabad Marriott Hotel 31st August to 3rd September was very nice. We enjoyed the scenic location, the excellent service, and the relaxing ambiance. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Hyderabad, whether for business or leisure.",

I went to reception to change this, the next day, still the same. Very frustrating. This then continued for the next day! Incredibly annoying and a display of the poor systems which they clearly have in place here.\n\nSecondly, the transport. I asked the hotel to arrange a car for me to go to a shopping mall. They quoted me 30,000INR for a 12km round trip. Absolutely crazy.\nObviously, I then used Uber who charged me a total of 3,500INR. This hotel was X10 the amount of Uber. Absolutely embarrassing and poor customer care.\n\nThe following day I then asked them to quote me to use a driver for the whole day (200km trip) and they told me they don\u2019t have any cars available. Understandable I suppose, but they were unwilling to organise me a car of any sort. Incredibly unhelpful.\n\nTo end on a positive, the hotel rooms are nice and clean, beds are very comfortable and the food was delicious.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel and won\u2019t be returning.
