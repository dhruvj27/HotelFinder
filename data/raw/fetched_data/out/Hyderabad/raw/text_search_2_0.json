From the start, the vibe felt off \u2013 the lobby begins on the 3rd floor and lacked the welcoming feel I expected. The reception had all new faces who seemed inexperienced, which didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s design feels flawed. The swimming pool is placed right next to the dining area, which makes swimming uncomfortable and also raises concerns about diners accidentally dropping things into the pool. My room had a bathtub with no proper drainage, so water spilled into the room. The only good part was the cleaning staff on the 8th floor who kept cleaning up the mess \u2013 though it clearly seemed like a daily extra burden for them due to poor planning.\n\nThe passages were dimly lit, there was no proper gym, and the balcony had no view. While some of the 3rd-floor staff were decent, the bar staff mocked customer choices \u2013 something I\u2019d never expect in a 5-star hotel. The overall vibe felt more like a casual hangout spot rather than a premium hospitality experience.\n\nNot the luxury stay I had hoped for. Management really needs to address these issues.",

We had booked 4 rooms and were allotted the Palm Villas, each priced at \u20b915,000 per night \u2014 shockingly higher than many 5-star hotels in Hyderabad.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience was far from premium. The rooms were in a pathetic condition. There is no proper drainage system; the showers were clogged and only 2 holes were functioning, with bore water full of waste. The bathtubs are directly connected to drainage pipes without filters, making them unusable and unhygienic. The bathrooms were sinking, and the foul smell even entered the bedrooms.\n\nWhen I raised these concerns the next morning, the front desk casually said all rooms are like this and that they were sold out \u2014 clearly showing no interest in customer satisfaction.\n\nRoom service was equally poor. You need to call multiple times before anyone even responds. For a place that charges premium prices, the service and quality are severely lacking.\n\nI do not recommend this resort to anyone. It\u2019s overpriced, poorly maintained, and not even close to basic hospitality standards.",

            "text": "Disappointing Experience at Golconda Resorts & Spa \u2013 Not Worth the Price\n\nI recently stayed at Golconda Resorts & Spa for 2 days with my family. We had booked 4 rooms and were allotted the Palm Villas, each priced at \u20b915,000 per night \u2014 shockingly higher than many 5-star hotels in Hyderabad.\n\nUnfortunately, the experience was far from premium. The rooms were in a pathetic condition. There is no proper drainage system; the showers were clogged and only 2 holes were functioning, with bore water full of waste. The bathtubs are directly connected to drainage pipes without filters, making them unusable and unhygienic. The bathrooms were sinking, and the foul smell even entered the bedrooms.\n\nWhen I raised these concerns the next morning, the front desk casually said all rooms are like this and that they were sold out \u2014 clearly showing no interest in customer satisfaction.\n\nRoom service was equally poor. You need to call multiple times before anyone even responds. For a place that charges premium prices, the service and quality are severely lacking.\n\nI do not recommend this resort to anyone. It\u2019s overpriced, poorly maintained, and not even close to basic hospitality standards.",

The apartment was clean, well managed, comfortable and more than i actually needed (since the staff was kind enough to offer me an upgrade).\n\nDaytime service could definitely use improvement but otherwise i would surely consider this place, especially when i am traveling with family or if i am looking for a longer stay. A bit disappointed with the points system managed by Marriott and slightly on the expensive side so that is something to consider.\n\nIt is also well located and having a mall with pubs and shopping stuff in the same building can be helpful. There was no noise disturbance from these additions though.\n\nSo overall i had a wonderful experience. Would definitely like to thank Subham (i hope i got the name correct).",

Its prime location was incredibly convenient, placing us within easy reach of all the major attractions. We especially appreciated the excellent public transport connectivity, with the Metro and taxis readily available right outside.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, we were impressed by how spotlessly clean the entire hotel was. The staff were incredibly friendly and approachable, always ready to assist with a warm smile.\n\nOne of the highlights was definitely the breakfast! As vegetarians, we were delighted with the wide array of delicious options, including some wonderful local cuisines. Huge kudos to the chef for preparing everything so incredibly tasty \u2013 it was a real treat each morning. We also found the food prices to be very affordable, with their Thali being a particularly great value.\n\nThe F&B Manager provided exceptional service, though a bit more attentiveness and approachability from other staff members would further enhance the dining experience.\n\nFinally, a special shout-out to Amandeep, who went above and beyond to ensure our comfort throughout our stay. His attentiveness truly made a difference.",

Cleanliness and housekeeping is amazing, special mention for Somnath for taking care of minute details of housekeeping. 5/5\n\nPool and other amenities are also very good but not at the level of some other Hyatt properties in India. 4/5\n\nFood is very good as well, no complaints on variety or taste. Bakery especially the croissants were done very well. Our compliments to the chef. Breakfast spread was very good as well. 4/5\n\nStaff is a hit or miss sometimes. It's a high class hotel so you come across many people who are furthering their careers and focus on doing the job well, hence the rating. A 5 on 5 rating for us is when staff constantly goes out of their way to delight the customers, that spirit felt slightly missing.  However Jagriti, Ram Babu, Megha and Ravinder (bee keeper) seemed to carry that feeling of customer delight and happiness very well, and I hope they are recognized and rewarded for it. I encourage the hotel leaders to spend time with these folks to understand customer delight at the grass root level.\n\nWorld of Hyatt loyalist recognition is average at best. We're Globalists and an upgrade based on availability seemed to be considered going the extra mile, which in truth is mostly policy. Nothing much was done for our experience as Globalists before sharing our feedback with the staff. Credit where due, things did turn around after we shared our feedback and we could experience the customer delight we were initially looking forward to. 3/5\n\nOverall there's nothing much to be fixed, more fine tuning and polish to optimize customer experience. We would definitely return on our next visit to this amazing city.",

I started feeling sick from the early morning of the 26th and stretched my day, assuming it was travel fatigue. However, the pain in body, throat itch became unbearable by the evening, and I asked if they had an In-house Doctor. The lady replied that there was one and that he would arrive in 30 minutes.\n\nThings start going wrong from here.\n\n1. The doctor arrives in almost 45 minutes (indeed, he can be late due to unavoidable traffic in the city)\n2. The doctor does the checkup and prescribes the medicine. Out of professionalism, we asked if any fees were to be paid. The doctor replied that the charges would be tapped under the room bill; however, if we want, we can pay him immediately. We agreed to pay immediately, and his stated fees were 3,000/-. (Being a 5-star hotel; if the customers are taking rooms and paying the uppermost rates of the city, you expect them to take care of you in every sense and not find ways to generate money. Even a 2/3 star hotel can identify a doctor and send them if the customers aren\u2019t keeping well; what matters is how they are taken care of) 3,000/- is an obnoxious amount for a simple check; I remember paying the same amount in Kokilaben hospital for a super-specialist service.\n\n2.1 - The disappointment was when the hotel charged for a doctor's checkup, whereas I feel the five stars I have stayed in last, as the Taj, Leela, ITC has always treated unexpected circumstances as a gesture and not charged.\n2.2 Even if the doctor charges, it cannot exceed 500/- for a doctor visit.\n\n3. As the doctor left, he said the hotel would be instructed to buy the medicines. To my surprise, I received medicines after 1 hour. Again, I am unsure whether sending someone is delayed or whether the regular medicine store in Hyderabad is all 10 km away from the hotel.\n\n4. they forgot to bring the prescription as I received the medicine. Again, as I said, please get my prescription; they took another 15 mins to bring it.\n\n5. When I shared my disappointment over the call and asked the on-duty manager to meet me, it took 1 hour for her to call me back/ not meet as I requested and understand my concern. She said that she would put these errors to a higher authority and, as always, suggested that if I need some food/ juice. (The customer isn\u2019t expecting the lack of turnaround time and  obnoxious charge to be compensated by juice/ food)\n\n6. The next day, the 27th, I go for breakfast and hand them over the Apple Watch and charger, requesting to charge. To my surprise, after 1 hour, when I went to receive the watch, it wasn\u2019t charged. Disappointingly, when I said it wasn\u2019t charged, the lady started justifying that she saw that it was kept on charge.\n\n7. At the last checkout and clearing of the room, I paid 979/- for the medicines doctor ordered. (After all the disappointments shared, still course you pay)\n\nWhenever I shared my disappointment, I heard, \u201cSorry, and I\u2019ll tell the higher authorities. \u201c. In the service industry, when a customer is disappointed, saying sorry isn\u2019t a part of repairing it, but a quantifiable effort has  to be demonstrated to fix it. As we take rooms in the 5star (claimed) hotels, I feel you don\u2019t go for luxury solely but to de-risk your experience and make sure that in the bad times, you will be well taken care of by meeting more than the required turn around times, fast service, over the top gestures and making things delightful.\n\nSadly, Park Hyatt of Hyderabad is full of Sorries, has the worst turnaround time, and has no lack of empathy and compassion; you are in your place by your own. I am pretty sure this won\u2019t be my repeated destination in future.",

This luxurious haven of hospitality truly embodies the essence of opulence and impeccable service. Allow me to share the remarkable details of my stay, which left me in awe and completely pampered.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived at Avasa, I was greeted by a grandeur that took my breath away. The hotel's stunning architecture, elegant lobby, and tasteful decor set the stage for a truly memorable stay. Every corner exuded sophistication, creating an ambiance of refined luxury.\n\nThe staff at Avasa exemplified hospitality at its finest. From the doormen to the receptionists, the level of professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness was unparalleled. They were genuinely committed to ensuring every aspect of my stay was flawless, accommodating any requests with grace and efficiency. It was evident that the staff took pride in their work and genuinely cared about the satisfaction of their guests.\n\nThe rooms at Avasa were nothing short of opulent. Every detail, from the plush bedding to the high-end furnishings, exuded a sense of indulgence and comfort. The attention to detail was impeccable, with thoughtfully curated amenities and luxurious touches that made me feel like royalty. The breathtaking views from my room added an extra layer of magic to the experience.\n\nWhen it came to dining, Avasa left me in culinary paradise. The range of restaurants and cuisines available was exceptional, each offering a gastronomic journey of exquisite flavors. Whether it was a lavish buffet breakfast, an elegant fine-dining experience, or a casual meal by the pool, every dish was a masterpiece. The talented chefs and attentive waitstaff ensured that every meal was a delightful symphony for the senses.\n\nThe facilities and services at Avasa were second to none. The spa and wellness center provided a haven of relaxation and rejuvenation, offering a comprehensive range of treatments and therapies. The state-of-the-art fitness center allowed for invigorating workouts, while the pool and recreational areas provided a perfect blend of leisure and entertainment. Every aspect of the hotel's offerings was designed to cater to the needs and desires of the most discerning guests.\n\nLastly, the attention to detail and personalized touches at Avasa were truly remarkable. From the welcome amenities to the nightly turndown service, every interaction and gesture made me feel like an esteemed guest. The staff anticipated my needs and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nIn conclusion, Avasa is a luxurious haven that redefines the meaning of exceptional hospitality.
