The dinner spread, while decent, leaned more heavily on Indian options.\n\nOne suggestion: While items are clearly labelled with allergen info, I expected clearer separation between vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, especially for people with allergies. For instance, pancakes (with egg) and eggless waffles were placed side by side, with a shared serving tong - increases cross contamination risks. As someone with a severe egg allergy, this was very concerning for me. While the staff always prepared fresh waffles for me on request, the arrangement / layout of dishes didnt change over the 5 days I had breakfast - i expect better allergen awareness and caution from a luxury property.\n\nSpecial mention to Sayantan @ front desk for a smooth experience, Susmita for her personal touch / calls about my experience, Abhisek who served us (during dinner on 7/10). Thanks team!\n\nOverall, it was a memorable stay - but a bit more attention to detail and timely accommodation of guest requests would elevate the experience further!",

A special thank you to Executive Chef Shibu for his hospitality and for making us feel so welcome.\n* The rooms were spacious, incredibly comfortable, and always smelled fresh \u2014 such a lovely touch that made our stay even more enjoyable.\n* We especially loved the outdoor terrace in the evenings. My husband and I would unwind there with some amazing mocktails and great music \u2014 it quickly became our favorite spot.\n* The Front Desk team was fantastic and went out of their way to assist us during check-in, especially since we were traveling with my elderly father and had a few special requests. Their care and professionalism really stood out.\n* Location is good though there are no restaurants or malls immediately outside the hotel\n\nHilton Chennai truly knows how to make guests feel special, thanks to a team that embodies the true spirit of hospitality \u2014 warm, courteous, and attentive.\n\nNote: My review comes a bit after our stay, so some aspects may have changed since then \u2014 but the wonderful memories remain just as vivid!",

The property itself is spacious, clean, and very well maintained, with a strong sense of safety and comfort throughout.\n\nThe rooms are large, spotless, and thoughtfully designed, making for a truly relaxing stay. The dining options are fantastic, with multiple restaurants offering a great variety of delicious cuisines. The bar area is a great highlight, with live performances and a vibrant yet classy atmosphere that adds to the overall experience.\n\nI also made use of the spa and gym facilities, both of which are top-notch. The spa services were excellent, and the gym is well-equipped and clean \u2014 perfect for staying on track while traveling.\n\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the team of people working here. Every single staff member I interacted with \u2014 from the general manager and front desk team, to the concierge, waitresses, housekeeping staff, security guards, chefs, and kitchen team \u2014 was courteous, professional, and genuinely warm. You can tell there is a real culture of hospitality here. Everyone made an effort to ensure guests feel welcome, comfortable, and well cared for.\n\nA big thank you to everyone at the Hyatt Regency Chennai for making my stay so memorable. Highly recommended whether you\u2019re here for business or leisure!",

We chose Marriott for a safe and hygienic stay, fully dependent on the hotel for all meals.\n\nUnfortunately, both I and my son fell ill on separate days after eating at the buffet \u2014 I had stomach pain after a salad, and my son suffered vomiting and loose motions. The hotel management assured me that food samples had been sent for lab testing, but without any transparency or follow-up, I\u2019m unsure how effective that really is. I was also given the usual standard assurances about Marriott following \u201cthe highest food safety protocols,\u201d but our experience says otherwise.\n\nI also noticed the hotel seemed understaffed, with ground-level staff working long hours. Being close to the US Consulate, I feel the hotel has become complacent, relying on constant short-stay guests.\n\nI\u2019m writing this review not just to share my personal experience, but to ensure there\u2019s a public record. If others face similar issues, there will be a trail of repeated incidents for reference. I sincerely hope Marriott\u2019s senior management or global leadership looks into such cases and takes serious corrective action.\n\nSpending over \u20b91 lakh for a five-day stay \u2014 only to fall ill and spend most of my time managing my and my son\u2019s health \u2014 is not acceptable. Food safety and hygiene cannot be compromised, especially at a hotel of this reputation and price point.",

We chose Marriott for a safe and hygienic stay, fully dependent on the hotel for all meals.\n\nUnfortunately, both I and my son fell ill on separate days after eating at the buffet \u2014 I had stomach pain after a salad, and my son suffered vomiting and loose motions. The hotel management assured me that food samples had been sent for lab testing, but without any transparency or follow-up, I\u2019m unsure how effective that really is. I was also given the usual standard assurances about Marriott following \u201cthe highest food safety protocols,\u201d but our experience says otherwise.\n\nI also noticed the hotel seemed understaffed, with ground-level staff working long hours. Being close to the US Consulate, I feel the hotel has become complacent, relying on constant short-stay guests.\n\nI\u2019m writing this review not just to share my personal experience, but to ensure there\u2019s a public record. If others face similar issues, there will be a trail of repeated incidents for reference. I sincerely hope Marriott\u2019s senior management or global leadership looks into such cases and takes serious corrective action.\n\nSpending over \u20b91 lakh for a five-day stay \u2014 only to fall ill and spend most of my time managing my and my son\u2019s health \u2014 is not acceptable. Food safety and hygiene cannot be compromised, especially at a hotel of this reputation and price point.",

            "text": "I had the pleasure of staying at the Taj Hotel a few months ago during my visit from Punjab, and I must say it was an unforgettable experience. The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the exquisite food offered at the hotel. Every meal was a culinary delight, with a diverse range of dishes that catered to various tastes. From traditional Punjabi cuisine to international delicacies, the hotel's restaurant truly exceeded our expectations.\n\nWhat made our stay even more enjoyable was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff, particularly Jasmine. She went above and beyond to ensure that we had a comfortable and memorable stay. Her warm hospitality and willingness to assist with any request truly stood out. Jasmine's attention to detail and dedication to making our stay special left a lasting impression on us.\n\nThe hotel itself was a haven of luxury and elegance, with well-appointed rooms, stunning decor, and impeccable cleanliness. The attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel's design and maintenance was evident throughout our stay.\n\nIn summary, our experience at the Taj Hotel was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of outstanding food, a luxurious environment, and the exceptional service of staff like Jasmine made our stay truly remarkable. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area, and I look forward to returning in the future.\n\nReview from my Dad (Yadwinder Singh)",

I especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of fresh and delicious options to suit every palate.\n\nThe hotel also featured excellent recreational facilities, including a well-equipped gym, a serene spa, and a rooftop pool that provided a perfect spot to unwind. Whether I was relaxing in my room or exploring nearby attractions, the hotel provided a perfect balance of comfort and convenience.\n\nOverall, this hotel delivered a memorable and pleasant experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality service, luxury, and a relaxing environment.\n\nThankyou all le Meridien hotel\nTeam\nSpically Ms Namra",

The hotel's amenities were top-notch, providing everything I needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\nThe reception staffs, particularly Shibu the dining staff were incredibly friendly and efficient. They made the check-in process seamless and were always available to assist with any queries or requests I had throughout my stay. Their professionalism and dedication truly made a difference in my overall experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food! The hotel boasted some of the best food I have ever tasted, rivaling even the finest 5-star standard restaurants. The variety and quality of the dishes were exceptional, catering to a range of culinary preferences. I was thoroughly impressed with the presentation, taste, and attention to detail in every meal I had.\n\nThe hotel staff baggage carrying staff, wallet parking staffs and cleaning staff including the reception staff and the ladies responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, were outstanding. The bed sheets and towels were of the highest quality, providing a luxurious and comfortable sleep experience. The cleaning staff ensured that my room was always spotless and well-maintained, creating a pleasant and hygienic environment.\nThe amenities, especially the swimming pool and gym, played a major role in maintaining fitness enthusiasm. With state-of-the-art equipment and a variety of exercise options, the gym provided a perfect space for individuals to work on their strength and endurance. The swimming pool, on the other hand, offered a refreshing and low-impact way to stay active and improve my health Additionally, the availability of these amenities made it convenient for people who wanted to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being.\n\nOverall, my stay at Radisson Blue Egmore Chennai was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel provided a truly memorable experience that was worth every penny. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay in Chennai.\nLastly, I would like to suggest that you ask guests upon arrival whether they would prefer smoking or non-smoking rooms according to their requirement.",

They not only decorated the room with an improvised bunch of flowers and leaves and balloons; they also have the tastiest desserts I've ever had at a luxury hotel in chennai. The food spread at the restaurant too is simply the most scrumptious; I would highly recommend the buffet - because the experience of dining on the exquisite spread, with the friendly staff always ready to help, is quite amazing. Westin carries very positive energies.\n\nThis property is about an hour away fr the airport, but it is completely worth the experience. The rooms are very spacious, well designed and have a great view of the chennai city scape, mixed with their suave looking pool area. Getting here is not too difficult and Westin is located near one of chennai's biggest malls - the phoenix market City.\n\nA special note to the breakfast chef; she was exceptionally sweet, and left me with a box of goodies to take home with me during checkout. It was so very unexpected to be treated as if I'm leaving from home.\n\nNot only are the staff friendly, they are genuine people who listen and pay attention to your specific needs. If you'd ever stay at Westin, rest assured it'll be nothing short of a extravagant on all fronts - food, comfort, kindness, relaxation and rejuvenation. The spa too is a highly recommended experience, and it's better if you have a membership at Westin so you get to avail a host of services at competitive prices.\n\nI will always remember this birthday. Thanks to the Westin Velachery team for making it incredibly special.",
