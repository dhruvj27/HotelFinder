What truly stands out is the hospitality. The staff is incredibly friendly, courteous, and attentive, making sure your stay is seamless and stress-free. The hotel also offers great amenities, including a well-maintained gym, which adds to the experience.

ben002,ben002_r5,Divagar P,3,"The food at the hotel is genuinely good and probably the best part of the stay. However, the rest of the experience was Okay. The room provided was quite small and not worth the price.

The management was overly money-minded, constantly insisting on advance payments‚Äîeven for bookings over two days‚Äîwhich felt unnecessary and pushy. On top of that, they have very rigid policies: guests are not allowed to visit, and outside food is strictly prohibited. These restrictions made the stay feel more like a controlled environment than a comfortable hotel experience.

My stay at Hotel Grand Kalinga in Bangalore was extremely disappointing. The moment we arrived, we noticed a strong stench in the lift and the room. The bed sheets were smelly and clearly not fresh, the room was unhygienic, and the closet was broken and unusable.

The so-called ""complimentary breakfast"" was a joke ‚Äî there were just a few bread crumbs left with no refills in sight. Despite multiple guests requesting more food, the staff didn‚Äôt respond. When we politely asked about it, the manager came out and behaved rudely, shouting at us and others, saying we should have come at 8 AM. This was shocking, especially since we were told at check-in that breakfast would be available until 10:30 AM ‚Äî we arrived at 9:30, well within that time.

The manager‚Äôs attitude was unprofessional and disrespectful. His rude behavior and lack of basic courtesy were unacceptable and set a terrible tone for our stay. This hotel may have ‚ÄúGrand‚Äù in its name, but it was anything but. I strongly advise avoiding this place ‚Äî it's not worth your time or money.",2025-05-10T14:21:47.663012Z,3 months ago

Room service was extraordinary. Food was very good. Breakfast buffet had limited options but we could always order if anything is needed. We couldn't have breakfast early in the morning so got it packed to room at no extra cost.
They say pool water is temperature controlled but in actual it was not. Spa, gym and pool facilities are available. Spa is way too costly. Gym was well maintained. Pool was well maintained too.

Our experience at The Grand Magrath Hotel, Bangalore was extremely disappointing.

This kind of negligence is absolutely unacceptable, especially in the hospitality industry where dietary preferences must be respected without compromise.

To make matters worse, we had specifically booked a king-size bed in advance, yet were given a twin-bed room despite being a married couple. This clearly shows a lack of attention to detail and complete disregard for guest preferences, even with a confirmed booking.

I recently stayed at this hotel during my official visits, and the location is indeed its strongest suit. It's situated in a very convenient spot, making it easy to access key areas of the city.

The Good
- *Convenient Location*: Perfect for business travelers or those who need to be close to major hubs.
- *Budget-Friendly*: Offers great value for the price, making it an excellent choice for those on a budget.
- *Decent Breakfast*: The breakfast spread is satisfactory and provides a good start to the day.

The Not-So-Good
- *Maintenance Issues*: The rooms, particularly the bathrooms, lack proper maintenance. During my last stay, I noticed a significant decline in cleanliness.
- *Bathroom Cleanliness*: The bathrooms were not up to the mark, with cockroaches spotted in the toilets. This is unacceptable and needs immediate attention.

Suggestions for Improvement
- *Enhance Housekeeping*: Regular and thorough cleaning of rooms, especially bathrooms, is essential to maintain hygiene standards.
- *Pest Control*: Implement effective pest control measures to prevent cockroaches and other pests.

Overall
Despite the issues with maintenance and cleanliness, this hotel remains a good option for those who prioritize convenience and affordability. With some improvements in housekeeping and pest control, it could easily become a top choice for budget-conscious travelers.

ben009,ben009_r2,S N,1,"""Hotel from Hell"" is not an exaggeration. My stay here was a series of disappointments, starting with the tiny, claustrophobic room that barely fit our luggage, let alone three guests.
The staff‚Äôs attitude was appalling. We requested extra water bottles, only to be met with arguments. They insisted only 1 litre per room was complimentary‚Äîeven for three guests‚Äîand anything more would be chargeable. Nowhere was this policy written or communicated. I had to escalate the issue via my travel agent‚Äôs customer care before they reluctantly handed over extra bottles‚Äîaccompanied by more unnecessary arguments and condescension, as if I hadn't stayed in hotels across five countries.
The hostility was unnerving, and I, a female traveler, genuinely felt unsafe. If I‚Äôd been travelling alone, the situation could have escalated further.
Housekeeping was equally disappointing: no daily linen changes, despite repeated requests. Basic courtesy‚Äîlike offering breakfast a few minutes early so we could catch our airport transfer‚Äîwas flatly denied. Breakfast starts at 7:30 AM; we had to leave at 7:35. No flexibility, no empathy.

2.	Substandard Amenities ‚Äì The bathroom amenities were shocking for a Taj property. They provided cheap ‚Çπ5 soaps instead of a proper handwash bottle. Even after multiple requests, they didn‚Äôt provide handwash and instead sent more small soaps.
3.	Unresponsive Reception ‚Äì Nobody answers calls at the reception, making even basic communication a hassle.
4.	Delayed Room Service ‚Äì Any food order takes over 45 minutes to arrive, which is highly inconvenient.
5.	Overall Service Experience ‚Äì The service quality is far below Taj standards. From the very first day, the experience was pathetic, stressful, and disappointing. Despite paying for 8 days upfront, the first day itself left us dissatisfied and regretful of our choice.

We had high expectations from Taj, but our experience at Vivanta, Residency Road, has been extremely disappointing. I would not recommend this property to anyone.

Very pleased with this. The location of the hotel was also very close to the shops, cafes and busy streets, just a short walk which was very convenient. The rooms were beautiful, very tidy, clean sheets and comfortable atmosphere with warm and welcoming decor.

Cons: Bathroom however, could use improvement. I liked the Japanese style toilet, but the showers could be improved. The water leaked everywhere due to the wide spray and high pressure shower head. It would get onto the shower curtains, the edges of the bath tub and eventually all over the bathroom floor, then to the corridor and up to the front door!!

Attended a business breakfast meeting today

I did attend a birthday party a couple of decades ago. Not sure it had the same name then..

Location is prime. Close to the shopping areas of Commercial Street, Safina Plaza and other lanes for smaller shopping especially. Close to Shivaji Nagar bus station and Russel markets. And Cubbon park of course.

The seminar hall in the hotel is small and a max pax of 50 people.  The ambience is average. AC not upto the mark. Plastic cups instead of glass tumblers given for drinking water.

The breakfast was okay. The water glasses   kept for drinking did not seem clean enough.

The ambience of the buffet and the lounge seemed average. Infact looks better only in
the pictures. ( Pls check my pics)

Im editing this post after staying here for 14days.
I am quite disappointed with my recent experiences at the Mosaic restaurant in Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, Bengaluru Hebbal Road. The ‚Äúon-the-table‚Äù menu service is extremely slow ‚Äî on one occasion, I had to wait at least 15‚Äì20 minutes just for a simple omelette, and on another day, the same delay happened for a boiled egg. Even after following up 3‚Äì4 times, there was no sense of urgency from the staff to serve the order. Eventually, on both occasions, I had to leave after waiting 20 minutes without being served.

The in-room dining service was no better. I requested two plates for lunch, and despite multiple follow-ups, the plates were brought only after 1.5 hours. This delay forced me to have my lunch at 4 p.m., which was extremely inconvenient and unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.

Overall, the lack of promptness, coordination, and basic service efficiency in both the restaurant and in-room dining was very disappointing. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and improves the speed and attentiveness of their service.",2025-08-08T06:45:25.869014450Z,4 weeks ago

It was a true pleasure to stroll through the pathways, and the constant presence of nature made the entire stay feel incredibly rejuvenating.

I must also extend a special thank you to Tia at the front desk. Her warm and welcoming demeanor made check-in a breeze.

ben034,ben034_r5,Vaishali Vinayak,1,"One of the Worst Hotel Experiences Ever

I rarely leave negative reviews, but I feel compelled to share my experience here. Unfortunately, this stay was nothing short of a disaster.

To start, the shower literally fell on my head while I was using it. It was a horrifying and painful experience that left me needing medical attention. I ended up in the hospital due to the injury, which completely ruined my trip. The staff, to their credit, were polite and apologetic, but that‚Äôs about the only positive thing I can say.

Despite the severity of the incident, the hotel did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. There was no offer of a partial refund, compensation, or even a complimentary service to acknowledge the disaster. Considering the price I paid for this stay, I expected a lot more in terms of safety and customer care.

While the staff were friendly, their hands seemed tied, and the management's lack of action made this experience even worse. Honestly, it was not worth the money, and I would highly recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for a comfortable, safe, and worry-free stay. Definitely not up to par.",2025-01-25T11:38:29.541021Z,7 months ago

ben037,ben037_r4,S M,3,"We had a good overall stay, though a few things could‚Äôve been better. The rooms, while compact, were clean, well-maintained, and offered a beautiful view of Haridwar - ideal for a business/solo stay. The shower area was surprisingly spacious, though I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the toilet and washbasin being combined. Still, it served the purpose well!!

A special shoutout to the Duty Manager from the Front Office who spoke to me before check-in; he was extremely kind and thoughtful. Since I had booked the stay as a surprise weekend getaway for my sister after a long work week, he arranged for a lovely handwritten note and a small pastry cake in the room. That personal touch truly made our arrival feel special!!!!

The gym and pool were great although we wish we had the time to use them!! At the restaurant, the service team was extremely hospitable - staff like Nandini and one more girl whose name I forgot were warm and friendly, and it made breakfast enjoyable. But, this was slightly marred when Subhash interrupted our chat and called them away abruptly, citing ‚Äúwork,‚Äù which felt unnecessary and unprofessional - brief interactions with guests should be welcomed, not shut down!!

The breakfast had an impressive spread of South Indian dishes, which were delicious. However, the bread section was a letdown - items like the toast, croissants, danish pastries, donuts, pancakes, waffles, and French toast lacked freshness and texture. I do hope they improve this area as they host more than just Indian guests. The chef was kind enough to check in and offer alternatives, which we appreciated!!!

One area that truly fell short was the handling of my late checkout request. The Front Office Manager Mr. Mallik said he would check and get back to us reg our request while he was checking us in the late evening, but never followed up. When I ran into him the next morning at the lobby, he didn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all or provide an answer - something as simple as a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù would have sufficed. That lack of basic courtesy was disappointing!!!

Despite these hiccups, the overall vibe of the hotel was good. With a few improvements in professionalism and breakfast variety, it could easily move from ‚Äúgood‚Äù to ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù It‚Äôs a nice spot for solo travelers - whether for a short trip or an extended work stay!!!!",2025-07-24T18:16:04.096149809Z,a month ago

The room was not ready even after a five-hour wait. The shower tap, TV, and room controller were all non-functional, and when we called for assistance, the response was extremely delayed. Basic amenities like plates were not provided, which should be standard in any hotel room.

Booking online cost us around ‚Çπ2800 for two people per day, whereas booking offline was about ‚Çπ3300 for a standard room.

The room was well-equipped with all the basic amenities you'd expect ‚Äî comfortable bed, good lighting, a TV, and a working desk. It was clean, cozy, and maintained well during our stay.

The washroom, while clean and functional, felt a bit old. Some fixtures like the glass partition in the shower area were damaged, and a few fittings showed signs of wear and tear. Nothing majorly inconvenient, but it‚Äôs an area where the hotel could definitely improve with some renovation.

Despite that, the service was top-notch. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. There‚Äôs also a small gym available, which was a pleasant surprise.

The room was small compared to other hotels, with basic amenities (soap, shampoo, towels, water) but no dental kit . The lack of an in-house restaurant was inconvenient; a digital scanner offered a limited menu, and dining in the small room was impractical. Breakfast was below average, with insufficient chutney and sambar, and the ordering process felt cumbersome.

The basement parking is small and congested but I found no problem as the staff helps with parking your vehicle.Other room types (1-2 BHK) might be better, but I didn‚Äôt try them.
The Porch Inn is okay for a budget stay near NIMHANS, but the small rooms ( I wasn‚Äôt able to work as there is no proper space in room for desk or chairs), and the night receptionist‚Äôs behavior make it hard to recommend.

Adding to the ordeal, today at 2 PM, when I tried to get some daytime rest, I was again disturbed this time by construction noises from renovation work in the property. Astonishingly, only after this disturbance was a room change even considered basic rest should be a given, not something guests must fight for.

It's basic courtesy for a brand like Marriott to disclose ongoing renovations on their website so guests like me can make an informed choice. The absence of this transparency is deeply disappointing.

Overall, a pathetic experience. The only reason this review isn‚Äôt a zero-star rating is due to the housekeeping staff and some other staff, who were courteous and professional.",2025-07-29T10:17:57.766282458Z,a month ago

ben057,ben057_r2,Shyju,3,"I recently stayed at the Taj MG for 3 days and had a mixed experience that I feel compelled to share.
The Positives:
The hotel's accommodation standards are excellent, and the staff are genuinely warm and welcoming in their greetings. You can tell they want to provide good service, and the property maintains the luxury feel you'd expect from the Taj brand.
The Issues:
Unfortunately, while the staff excel at pleasantries, they seem to struggle with proper room preparation and issue resolution. Upon arrival, our room had empty shower gel dispensers and a non-functioning TV - basic amenities that should have been checked before handing over the room to guests, especially given the hotel's star rating.
While the shower gel issue was resolved immediately when I mentioned it, it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. A hotel of this caliber should have proper housekeeping checks to ensure rooms are guest-ready.
More concerning was the TV problem. Despite raising this with multiple staff members throughout my 3-day stay and receiving repeated assurances that it would be ""looked into,"" the issue was never resolved. It's baffling how a premier property can fail to address such a straightforward maintenance issue.
Bottom Line:
For a property that positions itself as premium hospitality, basic room preparation oversights and inability to handle guest requests are unacceptable. While the physical property and staff demeanor are pleasant, the attention to detail and follow-through need serious improvement.
I expected much better from such an established hotel group.",2025-08-26T07:41:20.208117115Z,a week ago

The Ritz-Carlton hotel itself is very comfortable. I had no issues with the stay ‚Äî the rooms and amenities met expectations. However, I made the mistake of booking a package that included two meals a day (breakfast and dinner), and this turned out to be a major regret.

Dinner is served at The Market, the hotel's so-called continental restaurant, and both the food and service were truly disappointing. The atmosphere is chaotic ‚Äî dim lighting combined with loud conversations made it hard to relax. The food, even by the standards of Indian-style continental cuisine, was objectively bad.

I highly recommend not including the lunch or dinner package in your booking. Breakfast was decent, but dinner was a daily struggle.

Over the course of three nights, my companion and I left more than half of our food uneaten. I wonder if the staff ever paused to consider what that might mean. This restaurant simply does not live up to the global standards of the Ritz-Carlton brand.

The Person sitting in the reception by name Momtajul does not even know to talk properly.. he is very rude in talking to customers. He is talking in such a way that he is the boss and customers are his slaves.
He should be terminated or he should be taught the minimum manners. His way of speaking is not at all good.

The management should think seriously about changing of check in time from 1.00 pm to  6 o'clock in the morning.

Many people are vacating at around that time and the rooms are vacant but still they are asking the customers to wait till 1 o'clock because the room cleaning people will come at 10 o'clock...
If the same thing continues for some more time, you will be losing the business and regular customers.

If it is needed you can please ask the housekeeping people to come at 6 o'clock, clean the vacated rooms and go so that checking can be given in the morning time itself so that customers will not face trouble.

The room was spacious, clean, and pleasantly quiet, providing a comfortable environment throughout my stay. The hotel‚Äôs location was also ideal, being very accessible to my office, which made commuting easy and convenient in a busy Bangalore.

The breakfast service offered a good variety of options, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences. It was a great way to start the day.

ben063,ben063_r3,Subhra Sankar Dey,2,"Stayed here last night booking ID - 2Z890SRB for reference purpose for the Hotel Management Team to verify and overall, the experience was disappointing ‚Äî with one major exception: the breakfast.

Melange Restaurant served a genuinely enjoyable breakfast. The selection was decent, but the French toast stood out ‚Äî perfectly cooked, lightly crisped, and absolutely delicious. It was the only part of the stay that felt like it belonged in a higher-rated hotel.

Unfortunately, everything else fell flat. The rooms were shockingly small, barely enough space to walk around the bed as compared to it was priced at.

Worse still, the air-conditioning was a nightmare. The room remained uncomfortably warm and stuffy throughout my stay, with no proper airflow. To make matters worse, the temperature setting couldn‚Äôt be reduced below 21¬∞C, which made it almost suffocating and unable to sleep the whole night.

This hotel might work if you‚Äôre just dropping by for breakfast lunch or dinner, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a stay. The great French toast just doesn‚Äôt make up for the lack of basic comfort in the rooms.",2025-07-13T14:02:48.510156325Z,a month ago
ben063,ben063_r4,Cindy Marie,5,"My husband and I stayed here 3X for business most of the time, and the last visit was business/vacation.

We normally arrive very early in the morning, and the reception staff has always been accommodating, offering our requests such as early breakfast or late evening meals.

The room was always clean and inviting, making for a great stay. The housekeeping staff was always attentive to cleaning necessary things upon daily cleaning and even very helpful with laundry. They even extended their service when we found out one of the t-shirts was stained, and they offered to fix it and even offered our free laundry service. We also went to their spa, restaurants, gym, and pool.

ben064,ben064_r2,V Shah,2,"Rude chef and Cold Management - helpful staff.

Pleasant First: (Some slip between the cup and lip is fine)

The front office team was extremely prompt in addressing the challenges that I had and acted upon them swiftly. (Though critical expectations were shared much prior to arrival). Was courteous and quick.
The F&B Operation team was good and swift. They displayed a courteous approach.
Housekeeping was great; they maintained the room well and in order. (With the given limitation and property age)
Tea and coffee are well-made at breakfast, and the chef at the live kitchen making dosa is very courteous and empathetic.

Some Unpleasant ones: (Undesirable and unexpected from the hospitality standpoint)

The Executive chef was extremely rude and loud. Not only did he misbehave in front of the guest and the staff in the restaurant, but he was also aggressive and almost charged at me. What if he had hit me! He was unapologetic and unempathetic. The staff present there agreed to his misdemeanour and were surprised.
It‚Äôs a safety issue; a mentally unstable person is dangerous.
The bone of contention was that I demanded no or extremely low salt food ‚Äì I am on a dietary restriction and couldn‚Äôt have gobhi paratha on 9th July last day of my stay. (There was no proper alternative in the buffet on the same day) I requested Aloo Paratha, believing that it would be low on salt, as in the past 02 days it was, and normally in a 4/5 star hotel, one does not have to worry about the excess salt. However, Paratha came with more salt, which I brought to the restaurant manager's attention, who directed me to the executive chef.
He offered a chance to serve something else. We agreed upon Poha. I believed that the chef knows my salt threshold and will make the poha suitably. However, Poha came late and with high salt. Upon complaining about this to the chef, he got extremely hyper and was loud to convince me that I had a problem, and the salt was a generous amount. Well, this makes no sense when one is aware of the expectation of the guest.
The upma served the previous day on the cheffing dish was hard and was not well kept. I informed the chef about the same, too.
The restaurant is an open space with greenery around, bound to have fruit flies. The Cut Fruits and Sprouts were kept open on the counter, attracting flies. When you have a croissant in a closed lid, why were Fruits, Sprouts and Muffins kept open?
On arrival, the room was not blocked as per the shared expectation. The room booked was a corner room with a window facing the road, and it was a lot noisier. They shifted to another room, which also had a lot of noise, and were shifted to the third room, which was a smoking room(I had asked for a non-smoking room), but it was quiet and had no sipage smell, so I was fine to use it for that night. I was tired and had no energy after shifting 03 rooms. Apparently, the hotel didn‚Äôt have any other rooms.",2025-08-22T01:21:58.436408388Z,2 weeks ago

If you are going there with an online booking,
they will simply mistreat you and will not give you the Rooms stating that they don‚Äôt have any rooms available at the moment. Or they will simply ask you to cancel your online booking and book their hotel rooms via offline mode just to save the taxes. Or they will make you wait up till the check in time even when you request for early check in and ready to pay the extra charges just because you are travelling with your family and everyone is exhausted.

At the reception only, you will get the negative vibes that something is not right and they are simply taking the advantage of outside travellers those who are completely unfamiliar with the surroundings.

The rooms were great. Spacious and clean, with great views of the city. The breakfast spread was also very nice. The stay was good and the restaurants seemed nice and the restaurant staff were very welcoming.

The check-in/front desk however, was not good.
We explicitly asked for 2 key cards and they gave us just one. A lady at the reception brushed me off quite rudely and insisted that she gave me 2 keycards. I had to get her boss involved and she was too arrogant to even acknowledge her mistake.

At check-out, I got my change in cash and another lady (different one from check-in) at the reception was quite condescending for some reason and decided by herself to shortchange me by 64 Rs. Its not a big amount, and I would have been fine with it, if she had only asked me first. It doesn't matter if its 1 rupee as well, it is only common courtesy to ask my permission first.

Overall, the hotel itself is nice but the reception staff damaged my experience a lot.

Edit (Aug/20): We reached out to the person who commented below on Aug/11 and there has been no reply yet. Just proves the point that the service here is terrible.

I have stayed at Shangri-La multiple times before and always held it to a certain standard, but this visit was nothing short of a letdown. Right from check-in, the experience was marred by Gautam‚Äôs rude and unbothered attitude. When we reached the room, it reeked of a foul smell. On calling the service center, the first housekeeping staff walked in completely clueless and uninterested. His supervisor, Umesh, casually told me to ‚Äúcheck with the front desk‚Äù if I wanted a room change something I never expected to hear at Shangri-La, where hospitality has always been seamless.

It only went further downhill. When Pavan came to assist us with moving bags to the other room, he literally made a face at us, banged the door, and walked away  a level of rudeness that was simply shocking for a brand like this. Breakfast was equally chaotic. All we asked for was a takeaway, only to be brushed off by a staff member who pointed us to another counter while standing in front of a whole stack himself.

At checkout, Laqshay didn‚Äôt bother to ask about our stay or invite feedback perhaps because they already know how poor the experience is. all we got was a flat, meaningless ‚Äúsorry.‚Äù

ben078,ben078_r2,S M,4,"recently stayed at JW Marriott in Bengaluru for a week with my leadership team for a business conference. While my overall stay and hospitality was warm and welcoming, there were some surprising lapses in service that I wouldn‚Äôt have expected from a brand of this caliber!!!

The highlights? The little touches that made me feel at home. Payal from JW Kitchen greeted me every morning with a warm smile and recognized my room number by my face. Athili, the lovely housekeeper, did a fresh flower d√©cor on my bed each day and created the most soothing turndown tub service after long workdays. Dinesh from the concierge went above and beyond by bringing me medication when I wasn‚Äôt feeling well - even though I had only requested for a cup of cumin seeds. The AYS team was consistently responsive and polite. Laasya from Guest Relations made my day with a sweet JW note and treat for being a Bonvoy member. Sakthi from the wellness center took care of us with genuine kindness during facility maintenance. And Abhishek from housekeeping was always warm and engaging in our interactions!!

Other favorites from my stay included the fantastic breakfast spread, the well-equipped wellness center, pool, and gym, and the beautiful view of Cubbon Park from my room‚Äôs balcony. The smiling restaurant staff, who patiently served me without a single frown, truly elevated my experience, and I really appreciate each and everyone from the F&Brb team! They did a fabulous job!!!!

However, there were some aspects that fell short. One day, I returned to my room and found a small dead roach inside a paper bag of breakfast bread I had packed and accidentally left behind. While I can‚Äôt say for sure whether it came from the kitchen or the room, it was alarming. Housekeeping was inconsistent with some basic stuffs like one of the trash bins left uncleared, the kettle not cleaned for nearly five days, and essentials like water bottles and glasses were sometimes not restocked. I ignored these, thinking they were one-time misses, but it began to feel like a recurring pattern. At breakfast one day, my simple request for a one-egg cheese masala omelette with chicken sausages got messed up - twice!!!

One particularly disappointing experience was when I arranged a surprise room decoration for the son of our company‚Äôs COO (who was also staying there). I had clearly asked the GRM, Sanchita, to inform me once the guests had stepped out before starting the decoration - but she didn‚Äôt. The surprise was mishandled. Karan, the RDM, made a kind gesture to redo the setup in another room and added our gift, which I truly appreciated. However, neither he nor the original GRM followed up with me or met me afterward. Sanchita, in particular, didn‚Äôt acknowledge the oversight or offer a sincere apology, and I truly feel that she doesn't have the eye for detail that a GRM should have!!

Despite all this, I want to highlight that many team members were truly exceptional - their warmth, smiles, and willingness to go the extra mile made parts of my stay genuinely memorable. But at a JW Marriott, I do expect the basics to be non-negotiable: clean and well-serviced rooms, consistent housekeeping, and accurate attention to guest requests. That‚Äôs what defines luxury!!

I hope this feedback helps the team improve and better align guest experiences with the high standards JW is known for!

Would I return? Possibly yes - or maybe not!!! Only time can tell that!!",2025-07-30T15:11:41.919047129Z,a month ago

ben079,ben079_r5,Karpagam Prabhakaran,1,"My recent stay at the Lemon Tree Hotel, Ulsoor, was unfortunately far from satisfactory and left much to be desired.Upon checking in, the immediate impression was the extremely cramped room size. Despite booking for two occupants, the room felt barely adequate for one, let alone two adults and a child. The ""bed,"" if one could call it that, was laughably small ‚Äì it seemed designed for a single person, making our stay incredibly uncomfortable and frustratingly restrictive for a family. Sleeping was a constant struggle, with little to no space for movement.Beyond the inadequate room, the noise levels were utterly unacceptable. Throughout the day, our stay was plagued by the incessant sounds of carpentry work emanating from within the hotel. This constant hammering, drilling, and sawing made it impossible to relax, work, or even have a quiet conversation. It completely disrupted any semblance of peace we hoped to find, turning the hotel into a construction zone rather than a place of rest.The combination of the claustrophobic room, the unbearable noise pollution, and the impractical bed size made our experience genuinely regrettable. What should have been a comfortable stay turned into a persistent source of irritation and discomfort. I would strongly advise against booking this hotel, especially if you are travelling with more than one person or a child, or if you value peace and quiet during your stay.",2025-07-31T07:23:24.009734746Z,a month ago

The alchemy restaurant has a beautiful view of the city and although I don‚Äôt drink, it does seem like a treat for people who like a fresh pint of beer and it‚Äôs very possible because of their own microbrewery.

ben082,ben082_r2,A,1,"Rooms and facilities seem opulent but beyond that this place is empty: the biggest downfall is the inexperienced staff and lackluster food scene.

While housekeeping staff really seemed to care about customers, the leadership team and front desk seem to be doing this as just a job, and don‚Äôt care about providing the best customer service. There is no passion or energy needed for the hotel business.

Front desk and restaurant staff need retraining on basic etiquette and how to respond to feedback. Their interactions are almost robotic. Would recommend staying at the Ritz Carlton or the Leela to learn what great service looks like!

We tried Cur8 for breakfast and dinner, and Far & East for dinner. Food at both places does not have taste or originality, and leaves nothing to be remembered. At Rs 8000 for an entree and appetizer, Far & East is a total joke. The service was a total failure as well. Check out Yataii in Shangri-La instead if you‚Äôre looking for great food and service.

We realized opulence and throwing money at the outside appearance and architecture alone like Four Seasons does, cannot buy great customer experience.

Rooms are not maintained well. Things are broken, cracked, bathroom isn‚Äôt properly cleaned. Our TV set top box had to be changed pretty much as soon as we checked in.

However, once we were inside the elevator, a bell boy abruptly stuck his hand in to stop the door and demanded identification for ‚Äúsecurity reasons.‚Äù I understand the need for security, but the approach was unprofessional and made us uncomfortable.

It was raining heavily and I was traveling with my wife and infant, so I asked the front desk if they had an umbrella we could borrow. The response was curt and dismissive‚Äîthey said umbrellas were only for staff to escort guests, not for guests themselves. Later, when I asked again while escorting my brother to his vehicle, they claimed a guest had taken the only umbrella to smoke outside. Hard to believe that a supposed 4-star hotel has just one umbrella for all its guests.

The rooms were clearly in decline‚Äîworn-out furniture, tired interiors, and generally not well-maintained.

The only redeeming factor was the food‚Äîthe buffet breakfast and dinner were both delicious, with a wide variety and good quality.

When I finally entered the room, it was nothing like what was shown on the booking site extremely disappointing.- But your receptionist was not giving any other option rather than paying and why you wont give any other justification for my below comments ??

The internet connection was terrible. Even when connected, it kept disconnecting or had no access at all.

At checkout, I asked for an invoice. The receptionist said she was a little busy and would send it to me on WhatsApp. I agreed, thinking I was being polite, but that was my mistake. It has now been 2 weeks, and despite chasing them multiple times calling and following up I still haven‚Äôt received it. Every time, they say ‚Äúshortly‚Äù but never actually send it.

When I checked in, I asked for the Wi-Fi password. The receptionist said she would send it on WhatsApp but after 3 hours of waiting, I had to go back to reception to get it myself.

The reception staff keep forgetting (or ignoring) your requests as soon as you walk away.

In the end, I will never recommend this property to anyone, and I will never come back.",2025-08-19T09:16:08.627614886Z,2 weeks ago

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easily 5 stars‚Äîand if I could give more, I would!)

I recently stayed at RG Royal Hotel, and I must say‚Äîit was an absolutely wonderful experience from start to finish.

To begin with, the location is spot-on‚Äîwell connected and convenient for getting around. As for the suite I booked, it was very spacious, clean, and incredibly comfortable. The beds were plush and cozy‚Äîperfect for a good night‚Äôs rest after a long day. The bathroom was pristine, and the toiletries provided were top-notch‚Äîno cutting corners here!

What truly stood out, though, was the ambience‚Äîelegant yet relaxed, giving us the right mix of comfort and class. Whether I was hanging out with friends or just soaking in the vibe, it felt just right.

Now let‚Äôs talk about the food‚Äîoh wow! It was super, super good. Every meal was delicious and clearly made with care and quality ingredients. From breakfast to dinner, the dining experience was a delight.

In short: clean rooms, comfy beds, excellent amenities, delicious food, and great vibes. What more can you ask for?

I had a fantastic time here with friends, and I would strongly recommend RG Royal Hotel to anyone visiting the area. Will definitely return! ‚úÖ",2025-07-30T05:43:35.294867137Z,a month ago

Also lift access to rooms or marriage hall is not there. Only service lift is available from the kitchen side for materials not for everyone.

I particularly loved the attention to detail ‚Äì from the complimentary toiletries to the neatly arranged tea and coffee station. The view from my window was breathtaking, offering a perfect backdrop to wake up to every morning.

One of the highlights of my stay was the food. The breakfast buffet had a wide range of options, catering to both local flavors and international tastes. Everything was fresh, well-prepared, and delicious. I especially appreciated the live counter where dishes were made to order ‚Äì the chefs truly knew how to impress. Dining at their in-house restaurant for dinner was equally wonderful, with attentive staff and a menu that balanced creativity with traditional favorites.

What truly set this hotel apart, however, was the service. Every member of the team went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. Whether it was the front desk assisting me with travel tips, housekeeping ensuring my room was always in pristine condition, or the restaurant staff remembering my preferences, the level of care and professionalism was remarkable.

The food was absolutely top-notch ‚Äî each dish beautifully presented, flavorful, Whether it was the rich Indian delicacies, the globally-inspired dishes, or the decadent desserts, everything surpassed expectations. The ambiance is elegant yet inviting, and the service (once seated) was warm and attentive.

However, I do feel compelled to highlight one recurring issue: reservations. Despite booking in advance, our table wasn‚Äôt ready on arrival, and we had to wait significantly past our reservation time. For a hotel of this caliber, better reservation management would go a long way in improving the overall guest experience.

That said, the food more than made up for the initial hiccup. I‚Äôd still recommend dining here, especially if you‚Äôre looking for a special culinary outing ‚Äî just be prepared for a potential wait, even with a reservation.",2025-07-08T16:29:31.301822491Z,a month ago

We opted for twin bed suite room with the turf view. The room seemed well-maintained and hygienic. The view was so serene with a wide view of the turf and seeing the horses being trained in the mornings makes you feel calm.

Yes, the organisers of the event Didn't plan the event nicely. But the hotel team Didn't as well.

In the menu, one of the dishes were veg Manchurian, when they had to refill, probably they were out of Manchurian and in the gravy they had put dahi ke kebab. I mean like seriously? Who does that? I mean a dhabha also wouldn't do this. What if someone is lactose intolerant and has that? Anyway, that's not even the point.. the point is at a 5 star hotel.. food shortage happened (which is okay) but you can't serve anything and think that the guests are fool, they won't realise.

And I am like 1000% sure they were dahi ke kebab as I am a chef turned into a food safety auditor.

The plates and spoons- super dirty. Food marks present, water marks still there. Not washed properly,  and not even tried to wipe. Cutlery had smell.

I also couldn't find any bins in the public areas.. i mean that's weird, probably some policy or something.

The smoking zone in the restaurant-- idk how often it is cleaned and the buds are trashed out. I mean i like went 4-5 times.. and it was same.

Only good thing - the public areas washroom (that too only lobby) was well maintained.
The washroom at the conference floor (2) - no one bothered to check the cleanliness or the toilet roll replenishment.

Also - the uniform if the service team during the meals... it Didn't feel like i was attending a conference at a 5 star hotel that too sheraton.

It‚Äôs a short walk to common areas but there are golf carts if needed and the greenery adds to the charm. Since its heritage there are no elevators to the individual buildings which are G+1, so just be mindful of booking ground floor rooms only when booking for elderly or people with mobility issues. The food is good and the breakfast is well thought out. It can get a bit chaotic when it is full house like over the long weekend.
Special mention to our housekeeping staff Therthei, who worked alone and was super efficient in getting our room tidy for us always. The duty manager also was kind in offering to switch our room and offered us some treats in the room when we complained about a minor noise issue.

Pros:  The Ayurvedic oil massage was amazing.  The spa treatments are relaxing. I especially liked the steam room.  For the classes, I enjoyed the meditation instruction.

Cons:
My dining experience was subpar. There were few options for a light diet, as I had requested. I ended up just having toast and tea, and no protein options.  I missed the group dining set up from the prior stay, where I got to meet people from around the world. This time, the table set up felt isolating, and meals were quiet and the environment felt somewhat depressing. I learned that the retreat is focusing on treatment and discouraging socializing.

I enjoyed the cottage experience the last time, but there were upkeep issues this time. On my first day, Black ants were crawling on the toilet in my room. It required multiple follow-ups to get a change to a new room.

The yoga classes were okay. On my last day, I learned from another visitor, that there were more advanced yoga classes.

Food & Variety:
The quality of the food was good, but the options were quite limited across all categories‚Äîstarters, main course, and desserts. Other hotel brunches we've tried included a wider selection from Indian, Japanese, Chinese, and Italian cuisines, making feel more value for money.

Taste & Presentation:
The dishes were well-prepared, but nothing particularly stood out. The presentation was decent, and the food was fresh, but not extraordinary for the price paid.

ben126,ben126_r5,Andrew Goh,4,"This was my first time staying at this hotel, which I chose for its proximity to our meeting location. The room was decent, though I was initially assigned two single beds instead of my usual preference for a king bed. However, I was later upgraded to a suite.

The shower lacked a proper screen, causing water to spill out, and the water temperature turned cold after use. The amenities were sufficient but of low quality, such as the toothbrush. The pillows were too soft for my preference, so I had to stack two. The working desk felt cramped in the corner, and the power outlet was inconveniently hidden inside a wooden cabinet‚Äîit would be better if it were more accessible.

Breakfast was excellent, especially the Indian food, which I enjoyed the most. The waitress took orders and served them at the table, providing amazing service. The vegetarian options were delicious, though the non-vegetarian selection could have been more varied.

For lunch, we dined at the same cafeteria, and the food was outstanding, particularly the fish curry, prawns, and lamb biryani. However, the food at the poolside bar was just average. We had a private room next to the bar, but it was uncomfortably hot, as the air conditioning didn‚Äôt seem to work properly.

The hotel is located outside the main city, near a business district. While the distance to key locations may seem short, the traffic is intense, so extra travel time is necessary.

I prefer the larger hotels with multiple options for food. One night I ordered room service which was fine, but they couldn't bring me a cocktail and they couldn't tell me why or what they could bring, just that they didn't have what I was asking for, so I don't know if it was time or policy or selection (I asked for 2-3 different options to make sure it wasn't an ingredient).

I had the chance to stay at this hotel for six weeks during my very first trip abroad, and everything went extremely well.

The staff is exceptional: always attentive, friendly, and smiling‚Äîwhether at the front desk, the bar, or the My Place restaurant. You feel welcome and well taken care of from the moment you arrive. Some staff members even spoke a little French, which added a fun and friendly touch to the experience.

The rooms and common areas are clean and well maintained. Of course, there's always room for improvement, but it‚Äôs already very good and more than comfortable for a long stay. If any small issues came up, the staff was quick to respond, which is much appreciated.

A few points could be improved:

The gym is a bit outdated.

The pool is nice, but not well-oriented for sun exposure, so the water is quite cold.

The rooftop was not accessible. It‚Äôs been closed for several years I think, which was a real disappointment, especially since I was looking forward to enjoying it.

The hotel is located a bit off the main road, on a small side street. The upside is that it‚Äôs peaceful, with no traffic noise. However, since the hotel is quite far from downtown Bangalore, you should expect about an hour‚Äôs drive if you want to enjoy the city‚Äôs atmosphere and activities. On the positive side, the location is convenient for the airport and for nearby business areas, which was ideal in my case.

I want to sincerely thank all the hotel staff. I won‚Äôt mention any names here, for fear of forgetting someone, but everyone‚Äîfrom the reception to the bar and restaurant‚Äîwill recognize themselves. Thank you for your kindness and professionalism.

We travelled from Dubai and expected to be in a great place to stay. Unfortunately, the experience was far from what we expected for an international hotel with 4 Star rating. The experience was horrible.

1. The air conditioning in 2x rooms was completely non-functional, making it extremely uncomfortable, especially for children. Whereas 1x room AC was super chilled, something wrong with thermostats. We reported the issue to the management and no action was taken.
2. Additionally, all room keys consistently failed, causing further inconvenience every time we tried to access our rooms.
3. Clogged washrooms, broken flush panels resulted in not flushing the Pee and Poop properly. The technician came with plunger to unclogged the feces from WC. Attached pictures as proof.
4. Rusty and fungus in washrooms, unhygienic towels as if it‚Äôs in a 2 Star hotel. Cannot be compared with a 4 Star hotel.
5. Sticky plywood flooring in bedroom. It‚Äôs not mopped properly. One room has broken flooring.

For the price paid, this experience was unacceptable. It‚Äôs clear that the hotel has a serious and ongoing problem with its air conditioning system, maintenance issues, house keeping problems.

We strongly advise others to avoid this hotel. It was a nightmare for us, and certainly not worth the cost. I‚Äôm happy to share more information and feedback to owners, visitors and travel agents.

Food lovers will be delighted ‚Äî the in-house dining options offered a wide variety of delicious dishes, catering to diverse tastes. Every meal was a treat, with both quality and variety standing out.

Room service was prompt and professional, ensuring every request was handled quickly and with a smile. Overall, this hotel offers a perfect balance of comfort, luxury, and top-notch hospitality. Highly recommended for both leisure and business travelers!",2025-04-30T04:52:41.515604Z,4 months ago

That said, the hotel is conveniently situated between the Chickpete and Majestic metro stations, making travel by metro very easy and efficient.

I rarely leave reviews, but this experience left me no choice. I had high hopes while booking this hotel, expecting a decent stay and respectful treatment ‚Äî but unfortunately, what I experienced was the complete opposite. The overall atmosphere was cold, uncomfortable, and lacking the most basic sense of hospitality.

Their tone was not only impolite but also passive-aggressive, as if they had a problem with guests who didn‚Äôt fit their ‚Äúlocal‚Äù expectations. It was disappointing, even a little shocking, to witness this kind of attitude in a hotel located in Bangalore ‚Äî a city that welcomes people from all parts of the country and the world. The purpose of any hotel is to make people feel at home, regardless of where they‚Äôre from or what language they speak, and this place failed completely in that regard. I wasn‚Äôt expecting luxury ‚Äî just decency, kindness, and professionalism. Sadly, none of those were present. I checked out not just with bags, but with a lingering sense of discomfort.

This was honestly one of the worst and most uncomfortable hotel experiences I‚Äôve ever had, and I travel frequently.

Instead of being welcoming or helpful, their tone was cold, dismissive, and frankly, rude. It felt as if they had no interest in making guests feel comfortable ‚Äî and instead, acted as though they were doing us a favor by letting us stay. In a city like Bangalore, which is known for its diversity and openness, I never expected to be treated like I didn‚Äôt belong just because I wasn‚Äôt local. A hotel should be a space where people from different backgrounds, cities, and even countries feel safe and respected ‚Äî but this place had the opposite energy. Their attitude made the stay incredibly tense, and at no point did I feel like a valued guest. Basic hospitality, respect, and professional behavior were completely missing. I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews, especially negative ones, but this experience was bad enough to warn others. If you are someone who expects polite service, professionalism, and even a minimum level of courtesy, I strongly suggest staying away from this hotel.

I booked a triple suite for my family well in advance, paid in full, and still had one of the worst hotel experiences ever.
‚Ä¢	Check-in & Room Condition: Despite pre-booking long before our trip, when we arrived our room wasn‚Äôt even ready. We had to wait around 20 minutes after a long journey, and even then it wasn‚Äôt cleaned properly. On top of that, it wasn‚Äôt even a real triple suite ‚Äî just a double bed with a single bed awkwardly added. Very misleading, especially since we were charged for a triple suite.
‚Ä¢	Cleanliness: Bedsheets, curtains, and doormats were stained and looked like they hadn‚Äôt been washed in years. The entire room felt dirty and unhygienic.
‚Ä¢	Bathroom: The bathroom was worse than expected ‚Äî the flush didn‚Äôt work, the water was dirty and smelly, there was no hot water, and the bathroom window was broken,
making it unsafe and uncomfortable.
‚Ä¢	Facilities: None of the facilities listed in the booking were available. There was no TV, no Wi-Fi, no hot flask, and not even safe drinking water. At night, electricity would keep going out, making the stay even more unpleasant.
‚Ä¢	Food: Breakfast was included in the booking, but there was no food or even drinking water provided in the hotel.

I understand that with the amount we paid, one shouldn‚Äôt expect luxury. I have stayed in other hotels with a similar rating and even cheaper rates, but never have I experienced something this bad and unsafe. This place is not only misleading but also fails to meet even the most basic standards of cleanliness and safety.

Do not book this hotel ‚Äî it was a complete waste of money and a very disappointing experience for my family.",2025-08-20T11:58:25.798116243Z,2 weeks ago
ben149,ben149_r2,ar nachiappan,1,"Terrible experience. Please don't book this property. I booked this property via agoda. But receptionist tells eventhough after booking we need to call and inform why the he'll we need to do that. Terrible experience was they did not even respect my old age parents.

Receptionist also confessed property owner given him authority to share rooms to ones who pays high amount. Then why are they listing in 3rd party Websites",2025-08-14T08:11:50.090748211Z,3 weeks ago
ben149,ben149_r3,AR S,3,"To start with we booked Triple Suite room that stated it had Queen Bed that can accommodate 3 people along with that we booked an extra bed however, for our surprise we got Double cot which can accommodate just 2 members. We had no option and force to share with 3 people.

No Towel's nor Soap provided. Bathroom was too compact but, had basic amenities. The bathroom mat was changed before years I guess which was too dirty.

Other than that in the morning the Hotel had frequent power fluctuation due to which got stuck in lift twice luckily, somehow managed to get out by God's grace.

Drinking water they kept was pathetic to drink seems they just kept the bore water to serve Hot or cold.

If you are tight in Budget and ok to survive with these basic amenities then you may opt else please skip and choose a good hotel.",2025-04-16T15:10:08.684763Z,4 months ago

ben150,ben150_r2,Bhuvan B,3,"Visited for lunch
I recently had a mixed dining experience at Holiday Inn Express. It started off with the masala peanuts ‚Äî the portion was quite generous, but there was way too much lemon squeezed in, which overpowered the taste. I returned it, and thankfully, the second serving was much better and more balanced.

We also tried the burger and sandwich ‚Äî both came with fries. The food was decent, nothing extraordinary, but the serving time was a bit slow, which took away from the overall experience.

The highlight, surprisingly, was the dessert. The vanilla chocolate brownie was really good ‚Äî rich, warm, and satisfying.

Overall, the food was okay, service could be quicker, but they were responsive to feedback, which I appreciate",2025-07-01T19:20:42.593376910Z,2 months ago

ben150,ben150_r5,Ashmeet Singh,4,"I recently stayed at Holiday Inn Whitefield and had a comfortable and pleasant experience overall. The rooms were neat, clean, and well-maintained, but are small in size, no wardrobe, no hooks in bathroom (where to keep bathroom towel, clothes!!!) hence this aspect needs improvement.

Housekeeping did a great job in ensuring the room was tidy every day.

The hotel facilities are quite good ‚Äî from the well-equipped gym to the lounge and self laundary areas, everything was clean and functional. The location is also a big plus. It‚Äôs conveniently situated near the main road and bus stop, which made getting around Bangalore much easier.

The in-house restaurant served a decent variety of dishes. While the food is taste okay, the service was courteous. The breakfast spread was decent, I feel could have some more or some other variety, I found it limited and no LIVE dosa counter, only omlette available from live kitchen...

The front desk staff were polite and check-in/check-out was smooth and hassle-free. I also appreciated the security and overall cleanliness of the property.",2025-06-16T03:43:40.780197311Z,2 months ago
