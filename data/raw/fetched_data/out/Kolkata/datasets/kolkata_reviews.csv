kol001,kol001_r1,Anu B Sadasivan,5,"The Oberoi Grand, Kolkata – A Classic Experience

My stay at The Oberoi Grand was truly memorable. The hotel beautifully blends old-world charm with modern luxury. From the grand colonial architecture to the warm and professional service, everything felt top-class.

The rooms are spacious, very clean, and well-maintained. The food at the restaurants was delicious, especially the breakfast buffet with so many fresh options. The staff are polite, always ready to help, and they really make you feel welcome.

The central location is another big plus—perfect for exploring Kolkata. The pool area and greenery inside the property offer a peaceful escape from the busy city.

It’s a bit on the expensive side, but worth it for the comfort, quality, and hospitality you receive.",2025-06-26T16:09:34.390628454Z,2 months ago

If you plan to stay in the Esplanade area...do stay in Hotel Grand Oberoi.
You get a very good bargain at a range of 5k to 7k for a night, double occupancy during peak seasons for a big suite with all comforts.

You will love the decor & the amazing bengali/ Indian cuisine.

kol002,kol002_r1,Prakash Group,5,"-Star Review: A Memorable Stay at The Kolkata Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Kolkata Hotel, and I must say—it exceeded all my expectations. From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel genuinely welcome with their warm smiles and attentive service.

The room was spotless, spacious, and elegantly decorated, with a beautiful view of the city skyline. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and all amenities—from high-speed Wi-Fi to the coffee/tea setup—were thoughtfully provided.
What really stood out was the dining experience. The in-house restaurant served a delightful local Bengali cuisine.
The location is another big plus. Centrally located, it's close to major attractions, shopping areas, and public transport, making it easy to explore the city.
Special thanks to the front desk team and housekeeping staff for their exceptional hospitality. They were always ready to help with a smile and went the extra mile to ensure a comfortable stay.

Overall, The Kolkata Hotel offers the perfect mix of luxury, convenience, and heartfelt hospitality. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Kolkata—whether for business or leisure.",2025-04-19T07:43:42.383995Z,4 months ago

Police should raid that guest house for unlawful activity.

People who are giving this property are daily/hourly customers for unlawful activity!

Me and my husband had very bad experiences. We booked our hotel for 1 night, check in time was 12:00 PM. We already informed them. But when we got there, they asked “kato ghanta r jonno” means for how many hours?
We were a bit confused! I told we booked through MMT.
They were like “we don’t have any room available”
We said “but we paid for the room it should be available.”
They said within 30 min the room will be available.
In the meantime give me your ID(That was our biggest fault).
We waited, after 30 min they said the AC is not working, you guys can wait for hour or u can get non AC room.
We reported to the MMT.
We asked for refund but they denied!
After a riot we walked out of the hotel.
Outside of that hotel there’s a lot of scooty!
People around the colony watching us very badly.

I had a truly comfortable and pleasant stay at the Peerless Hotel. The location is convenient, the rooms are clean and well-maintained, and the overall ambiance is inviting. The hotel offers a good balance between comfort and service, with a helpful and courteous staff that ensures you feel at home. The in-house dining options are quite decent too, with a variety of dishes that cater to different tastes. Overall, it’s a reliable choice for both business and leisure stays.

**Shout-out to Sushma:**

A special mention goes to Sushma, who went above and beyond to make my experience even better. Her professionalism, warm demeanor, and attention to detail truly stood out.

kol004,kol004_r1,Vinod R,4,"The Lalit Great Eastern Hotel in Kolkata offers a mix of heritage charm and luxury. I stayed in the old legacy building, which had a unique atmosphere with its vintage architecture and even an iron pillar inside the room. The room itself was spacious, though the flooring had an issue as it kept getting uncomfortably wet during the stay.

The morning breakfast buffet was a highlight, especially the tea, which deserves a special mention for its excellent taste and freshness. Service overall was polite and attentive.

However, the hotel’s guest policy was disappointing—restricting outside visitors from 8 pm to 8 am felt unnecessary and unreasonable for a luxury property. A cutoff at 11 pm or midnight would be understandable, but an 8 pm restriction is more suited to a hospital than a five-star hotel.

Overall, while the heritage charm, spacious rooms, and great breakfast stand out, the wet flooring issue and impractical guest policy detract from what should otherwise be a seamless luxury experience.",2025-08-24T02:10:12.005249601Z,a week ago

Felt truly privileged to stay at such a beautiful property which has probably improvised and kept upgrading with the passage of time. Was intrigued by the 180 year old seal kept at the reception, and the vintage piano in the lobby area.

The room was impeccably clean and tidy. The window view was towards a lovely courtyard.

The breakfast spread was varied and quite vast, had  scrumptious food at the start of a very important day ahead.

The staff is extremely polite, well behaved and caring. They also extended our check out time by an hour and half which was very helpful as I was travelling with my senior citizen Father.

The proximity to Howrah station is a plus point, and there are quite nice restaurants in the vicinity in case you want to dine out.

kol004,kol004_r5,Su S.,3,"The Lalit has been our Kolkata hotel of choice for the past decades because of their amazing hospitality, however, this time we were really surprised at the service downgrade in the Front Office department.  We were given a lower category room than what we booked (luckily the type of room was printed in the registration form).  Only after we asked about this did the front office night manager give the reasoning that because the hotel was fully booked they had to do this.  So we were downgraded with no recourse, but since it was past midnight, we thought to take it up with front office manager in the morning.

Now for the part of our HORRENDOUS experience, the Front Office Manager, this gentleman was not even willing to listen to, or to look at the documents. His position was that as a Guest, we cannot understand what happened.  After showing him the photograph of the reservation form & registration form, he started flailing and shouting in an even higher tone. Luckily, the acting Hotel manager. Mr Sunayan was there to clear this issue with all the grace and hospitality that the Lalit Grant Eastern has always been known for. If it was not for Mr. Sunayan and the amazing staff at the Lalit, I think our trip would have been ruined. If the Hotel would like the name of the front office manager, please do let me know.
As for Mr. Sunayan, no words can express the relief of sanity and level of service he provided. The Executive Sous Chef, Mr Krishan Chaddha, made sure our FNB experience was amazing.

With the history I have shared with the Lalit, it would have been a sad ending if not for the service recovery by Mr Sunayan and his team.  Thank you.
I have deducted one star from Service, for the attitude of your front office manager.",2025-08-06T08:56:35.683017361Z,a month ago

kol009,kol009_r5,Active Media,3,"Kzar Corporate Hotel - Decent Budget Stay for Friends' Trip

We (4 friends) stayed at Kzar Corporate Hotel on March 11, 2025 for one night during our Kolkata visit. Booked 2 rooms - here's my honest take:

The Good:
✔ Rooms were clean and decent sized for the price we paid
✔ Beds were comfortable enough for a good night's sleep
✔ AC and TV worked properly (watched a late night movie)
✔ Location was convenient - close to Sealdah station, easy to get cabs
✔ Staff were cooperative.

The Not-So-Good:
✘ Breakfast was just okay - limited options (basic toast, eggs, some sabzi)
✘ No great views from our rooms (we were on 2rd floor back facing)

Honest Opinion:
WSe booked room(including breakfast), it served our purpose well as we just needed a place to crash for night. Not a luxury property but clean enough for budget travelers. The guy at reception was helpful in arranging our early morning taxi.

Would I stay again?

Yes, if I need an affordable no-frills hotel

No, if I want a proper breakfast spread or modern interiors

3.5/5 - Does the job for short stays with friends when you're out most of the day anyway.

Honestly the room that i recieved was next to the spa so there was a lot of noise that i could hear when i switched off the AC and heavy cigarette smell from the duct in the bathroom above the bath tub.

What they have got right is thier customer service. At about past midnight i developed a severe abdominal pain with nausea so i called the reception to let them know that i need to get to the emergency because i was unable to bear it. Priya at the reception took swift action and sent Nisha to my room , who accompanied me to the hospital( they arranged for a car with security) , stood and helped me throughout at the hospital and got me back to the room safely. I am immensely thankful to both of them for their kind support and help. Priya ensured to check on me the next morning too.

The location is great, especially if youre in town for the visa services nearby. But if you’re looking for a quiet place to sleep, this might not be the best choice.

Rooms: They’re not well maintained. Not filthy, but not as clean as you’d expect. The floors aren’t very clean, the bathroom has leaky pipes, and the taps don’t work well. The shower temperature is a hit or miss.

Noise: There’s a loud club on the premises. I was lucky it didn’t bother me much, but if your room is close to it, it could be really annoying. Honestly, I don’t understand why there’s a club in this hotel.

Gym: The gym hours are strange - it opens late and closes early, which was odd.

Hallways: They can get noisy. My room was near a maintenance area where staff kept their cleaning supplies. There were lots of banging doors late at night. A few signs asking people to be quieter would help.

kol011,kol011_r2,Rawa Serwan,1,"Overall, this hotel was very poor value for money and did not meet basic expectations. The issues were several:

The staff member at check in was extremely rude and unhelpful. They claimed our Booking.com reservation was cancelled and the only way to stay was to pay double the price upfront for a lower tier room. This was at 10.30PM so there was obviously no other real choice, which the staff member understood. At first the staff member claimed the hotel was fully sold out before claiming one room was available for double the price. This was clearly a scam.

Our room was a non smoking room. However, the room had an extremely heavy stench of smoke, and several cigarette burn marks.

There was a very long hair inside the bed. No one staying at the room had this long of hair, or this colour, so it can only lead you to believe they did not clean the bed.

The bed had three large stains on the sheets.

The shower was extremely dirty, with soap stains and hair from previous guests all over the place.

The room was extremely loud throughout the night, and in the morning with music / construction work.

The rooms are very dated and in need of maintenance. Things are held together with masking tape and poorly cleaned.

The WiFi did not work. Upon calling the front desk for assistance, we were met with a very rude and unhelpful staff member, who was dismissive. So, we did not have any WiFi during the stay.

If the hotel was half the price, it may be worth it. Otherwise, do not bother booking here. The city has much better to offer for similar / cheaper prices.",2025-08-22T07:07:06.599814854Z,2 weeks ago

She said it wasn’t her concern and that they only accept the guest’s card — even though they had already deducted the amount from the company card!

The owner can replace them using 1 nights money EASILY.

The staff is very well behaved, 5 star for that. But they might need 1 star training in order to deserve a 5 star rating. Welcome drink was a surprise though.

The rooms are spacious without compromise, safe was there, mini refrigerator, silent AC, the ceiling fan was wobbling and very noisy at low speed Room#405

The hotel's restaurant is very very nice and the chef is simply the best, we did meet him and thanked him enough.

The breakfast was sooo good. Everything from fresh in house watermelon and pineapple and papaya juices, different types of cornflakes, sweets, pastries, cakes and cupcakes, jams, butter, coffee, tea, palm dates, dry fruits, fresh cut fruits, parathas, poor and idlis and poha and what not. The last time I visited Kolkata, I had stayed at the LALIT GREAT EASTERN but this KEMPTON beat it easily believe me, just miniature if compared but a champion. I'll definitely stay here once again.

kol017,kol017_r2,Raj Bhatia,1,"Unacceptable Stay – Senior Management Must Intervene

This was one of the most stressful hotel experiences I have ever had.

Despite pre-booking, I was told upon arrival that no rooms were available. Instead, I was pushed toward their “next-door property” which does not integrate with Booking.com, cannot charge the same card, and insisted on a different card or cash. This setup felt extremely questionable and gives the impression the hotel is avoiding its Booking.com commitments.

At midnight, loud music started from one of the rooms. I complained at 12:20 am. Shockingly, the staff spent over three hours “trying to find the room.” Only at 3:45 am was a room change finally offered after I raised my voice. What’s worse, the manager Kaushiki never once came to address the issue or even offer an apology. For three hours of disruption and stress, her absence and lack of responsibility were unacceptable.

The problems didn’t stop there. At breakfast, there was a 25-minute queue while staff stood distracted on their phones. Only after guests made noise were we redirected to another restaurant. Later, my new room access was locked because the night-shift staff forgot to update the system.

When I raised concerns, duty manager Mohitri attempted to “calm me down” by sharing irrelevant personal stories about her own divorce even wrongly assuming I was divorced. As a solo woman traveler, this was not only unprofessional but also extremely uncomfortable.

This property is far below expected standards. I have stayed at Hyatt and experienced nothing like this – they value professionalism and accountability, which was completely missing here.

To the senior management team: Please take ownership and review the conduct of your managers and staff. This level of negligence, insensitivity, and lack of basic hospitality is unacceptable. I expect to be contacted directly about this matter.",2025-08-24T07:28:57.572486050Z,a week ago

Firstly, we got a room which were not renovated but still had the heritage feeling to it. Deal breaker was the washroom, the toilet seat was soo old and dirty with stains and the shower was just taking it's last breath. We were so disappointed that we had to ask for a room change and I must say it was promptly done.
The staff was always courteous and  keen to help.
Next day we went for breakfast buffet, and I must say it had nothing Taj about it. The spread wasn't that great and some of the stuff they made didn't tingle my tastebuds either. That was the most disappointing thing of our stay.
I must say at the cost of repetition the staff ( esp Mr Abhijeet) was truly Taj like and offered great help.
My feedback would be to enhance the buffet spreads and check quality control for the taste of cuisine. Also I see that renovation is in progress so I presume toilets and showers will get better after that.
I really didn't find it my moneys worth this time but hopefully they will improve. I live abroad and I proudly advertise Taj properties as premium esp for food.

The staff were friendly and helpful throughout. They offer both Premium and Deluxe rooms and maintain a good standard of comfort and service. One of the highlights was their in-house restaurant, Brio Kitchen. The food was excellent honestly, even if you’re not staying at the hotel, it’s worth visiting just to enjoy a meal there.
The hotel also features a rooftop banquet, which is a great space for events and gatherings. Overall, Brio Hotel is a great choice if you’re looking for a comfortable stay with amazing food.",2025-04-28T12:35:29.505333Z,4 months ago
kol020,kol020_r2,Santosh S,2,Rooms are good and staff is cooperative but no one has that sense to inform customer when they switch off the water line. Even after telling them they switched off again and I am not sure why again.I was told buffet breakfast and when I went to have breakfast they said it is alcarte as few guest are there where breakfast became limited.  Being a frequent traveller I have seen most of the brands are a bit flexible but here they are not. When you make or amend ur stay even if there is a genuine reason. If you have to become a customer trusted brand then you need to be customer friendly. That's my only advise. Service needs to be improved a lot to become best and stand in this industry.,2025-04-15T19:05:13.196403Z,4 months ago

Review:

Just wow! Attended the Poila Boishakh buffet at Brio Kitchen and it was truly a royal feast! From the Diamond Fish Fry to Daab Chingri and Gurer Payesh – every bite screamed celebration. The live paan counter and authentic Kolkata-style desserts were the cherry on top!

The ambience was festive, the staff was super courteous, and the food? Unlimited and absolutely delicious! A must-visit if you’re looking to celebrate Bengali New Year in style. Will definitely be coming back next year!

Highly recommended for all foodies in town!",2025-04-12T06:58:09.820146Z,4 months ago

I recently had the pleasure of staying at Brio Hotel, a quaint and charming property located in the serene Block 3 of Salt Lake, Kolkata. I booked a deluxe room, and the experience far surpassed my expectations. The room was beautifully maintained and had an upscale ambiance, making it feel like a luxurious stay rather than a budget option.

The service was impeccable. I requested extra towels and hangers during my stay, and the staff promptly fulfilled my requests with a cheerful attitude. The breakfast buffet was another highlight, offering a variety of Indian and continental options. Every dish was not only delicious but also thoughtfully prepared. On the day of checkout, I was running slightly behind schedule and requested an extension for breakfast beyond the usual 10:30 AM cutoff. The staff graciously extended the time until 10:45 AM without any hesitation, showcasing their dedication to guest satisfaction.

The reception team deserves special mention for their warm and helpful demeanor, which added to the overall charm of the hotel.

I wholeheartedly give Brio Hotel a big thumbs up and a well-deserved 5-star rating. I wish the team continued success and look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Kolkata!",2024-12-21T08:26:49.822260Z,8 months ago

kol021,kol021_r3,Kranti Arka Meher,1,"We checked in on time (before 2pm as mentioned) , we booked a family suite (5 adults , 2 double beds from agoda)

we paid the amount at the reception which was similar to the online price.

We went to the room , the electric lock was broken so a manual lock was replaced.

the 2 double bed wasn't there only a single bed and a chauffer bed was there , we inquired at the reception about our booking , they replied, ""we are terribly sorry we have given that room to other guests"" , how come they gave it when we have already booked it.

They offered, to get a certain amount of refund and cancel the online booking or they would adjust the food bill during check out time.

Their food was decent 5/10 and it was taking way too long time waited around an hour.

Now come to the room:-
•the floor was all rugs where multiple hair and dust accumulated not a single day for cleaning
•2 AC was there both not working ,the staff came to fix the ac later
•The room smelled awful when we came back to the room like the drainage.

Now the Room Service:-
•we asked for water they took 20 mins to fetch and give it to us.
• okay don't give us we will fetch our selves but no there wasn't a single water filter.

Location:-
It was a good location and everything was close

I stayed at this hotel  April 2025 and was initially happy with the room and basic services. However, I had a disappointing experience with the staff behavior.

In the morning, I went for a walk on the rooftop after getting permission from the room boy. But while walking peacefully, another staff member came and spoke to me very harshly, ordering me to go downstairs immediately. I felt insulted and uncomfortable by the tone and behavior.

There seems to be a lack of communication among the staff, and guests should not be treated this way. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and trains the staff to speak more politely and consistently.

Zone by the Park Hotel in Kolkata offers a truly pleasant experience that makes it a strong contender for a top-tier hotel in the city. The staff were attentive and professional, the location is convenient, and the overall design of the common areas is modern and inviting. The restaurant and bar facilities are excellent, providing a great atmosphere to relax and unwind.

However, the reason for the 4-star rating, and not a perfect 5, is a noticeable lack of maintenance in some key areas. There were a few instances where simple upkeep seemed to have been overlooked, such as minor scuffs on the walls, a flickering light in the bathroom. These are small details, but they detract from what would otherwise be a flawless stay.

This is still a hotel I would highly recommend, but with a bit more attention to these maintenance issues, it could easily be one of the best in the area.",2025-08-03T05:27:33.541934602Z,a month ago

They ensured that all bags were screened and guests were checked politely and efficiently, even during peak hours when there was significant movement at the entrance. At the time of checkout as well, the security team were extremely helpful in assisting with my baggage, which I truly appreciated.

The check-in process was smooth and quick, taking no more than 5–10 minutes. I was warmly welcomed by Ms. Swagata Biswas, who was the Manager on Duty as well as the Loss Prevention Manager.

My room was clean, well-kept, and consistently serviced each day. Returning after long working hours, it was always a relief to find the room fresh, tidy, and ready for a restful night.

The food, both from the in-room dining menu and the buffet, was excellent. I was particularly impressed with the South Indian dishes such as dosa and idly, which are often not up to standard in star hotels, but here they had a homely taste, complemented by a good range of condiments.

Check-in was smooth and hassle free. Rooms are comfortable.. Only issue faced was that the a/c took a long time to drop down its temperature.

Dining at Citrus was awesome. The spread was great with the varieties of bhajiya's (Bhaja in Bengali) of Brinjal and Parwar (Pointed Goird) were unique. Speechless for the dessert.

Though the entire staff was superb, I would like to appreciate Sandeep for his guest interactions. Having served in Pune, we could connect well in Marathi over Maharashtrian cuisine. And, Mayukh who was extra attentive and observant towards needs of every guest in the restaurant. He went a step ahead in anticipating what one needed before asking for it and replenishing the table with water or tissue before the last sip got over or before the last tissue was taken and this proactiveness applied to every table in the restaurant. Such quality not just comes with experience but also with a great commitment and integrity for ones work. Hats off to Mayukh for excelling in his work.",2025-08-30T02:14:11.110795587Z,a week ago

Rooms are not soundproof at all. I could hear people chatting at reception from my first-floor room over the loud edm blasted by the DJ.

I'm amazed that someone in management thought keeping a DJ blasting on the ground floor till 4 am, right under the guest rooms, was a smart move.

The reception staff was humble enough to shift me to a room far from the DJ hall, but honestly, not much changed. At least he did what he could.

Another thing: some rooms are internally connected by a locked door (hotel's lock, not ours). They say it's secure, but it can be opened from both sides, which doesn't feel safe.

On the bright side, banquet hall and service are great, hotel is well maintained... but if you can't sleep, what's the point?

The staff’s behavior was appalling, especially toward women. They lacked basic courtesy and seemed clueless about how to interact with guests respectfully.

To add to the frustration, room service insisted that bills had to be cleared immediately after ordering and couldn’t be settled during checkout. However, at checkout, we were able to clear the remaining bill without any issue, contradicting their earlier claims.

The Good:

The rooms were absolutely top-notch – spacious, clean, and elegantly designed with all modern amenities.

The ambience throughout the hotel was excellent – luxurious, peaceful, and well-maintained. Perfect for a relaxing getaway or a business stay.

The Not-So-Good:

Unfortunately, the service was a major letdown. From delayed room service to lack of coordination at the front desk, the hospitality didn’t match the Taj brand standard I expected. Requests took too long to be addressed, and overall staff attentiveness was poor.

Overall:
The property and rooms are fantastic, but the pathetic service experience really needs improvement. With better hospitality, this could easily be a 5-star stay.",2025-07-16T19:25:19.797779756Z,a month ago
kol038,kol038_r2,Arnab Ghosh,2,"We stayed at Taj New Town, Rajarhat for 3 nights in August with family, expecting a premium Taj experience. Unfortunately, while a few aspects impressed us, much of our stay was let down by poor food quality and service issues.

What worked well:

The rooms were spacious, well-appointed, and very comfortable — perfect for a family stay.

Location is convenient, with quick and easy access to the airport.

A special mention to the security staff — we accidentally left a phone behind, and they went out of their way to locate and return it. That was truly appreciated.

What went wrong:

Breakfast: Disappointing for a 5-star property — repetitive options with little variety, and the coffee was consistently bad.

In-room dining: Very poor experience. Despite clearly requesting non-spicy food (for health and family preference), dishes arrived overly spicy.

On our last night, dinner took over 2 hours to be delivered to the room — completely unacceptable for any hotel, let alone a Taj property. When it did arrive, the food quality and taste were far below expectations, especially given the premium prices.

Overall, service felt slow, uncoordinated, and not at the standard one associates with the Taj brand.

We chose Taj for its reputation of hospitality and excellence, but the food and service left us disappointed. While the rooms and location were great, the overall experience did not justify the price we paid.

From the moment you step into Taj City Centre, Newtown, you're enveloped in an ambience that whispers elegance and calm.

Adding insult to injury, the hotel had the audacity to charge for basic amenities like a toothpaste and brush kit, and provided only one bath towel for a room meant for two occupants. When we requested an additional towel, we were informed that it would come at an additional cost. The inefficiency of the lone staff member responsible for room service further exacerbated our dissatisfaction, as they were consistently unavailable when needed.

My recent stay at the Golden Tulip Hotel was thoroughly enjoyable, marked by a consistently high standard of service and a welcoming atmosphere.
From the moment I arrived, the staff truly impressed. They were not only incredibly customer-friendly but also highly knowledgeable about the hotel's offerings and the surrounding area. Their readiness to assist and their genuine warmth significantly contributed to a pleasant experience. This excellent service was a recurring theme throughout my stay, making me feel valued and well-cared for.
The culinary experience at the Golden Tulip also deserves praise. The food served was consistently good, offering a satisfying variety and quality that catered to different tastes. Dining at the hotel was always a pleasure.
While the rooms are described as compact, I found them to be perfectly functional, and more importantly, immaculately clean and nicely maintained. Despite their size, they offered a comfortable and inviting space to relax after a day out, demonstrating the hotel's commitment to guest comfort and hygiene.
Furthermore, the hotel's location is a definite advantage. Its convenient position made it easy to access various points of interest, enhancing the overall convenience of my trip.
In conclusion, the Golden Tulip Hotel stands out for its excellent service, good food, well-maintained rooms, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and a convenient location.

kol048,kol048_r2,Hello World,1,"Prior to my arrival, I informed the hotel staff on June 28th about my late check-in due to a late evening flight. I arrived at the hotel around 10:00 PM and completed the check-in formalities. However, the receptionist, Mr. Arman, immediately began questioning my check-out time. I informed him that I would check out around 3:00 PM on July 1st due to my flight schedule. He insisted that I pay for an entire extra day for a mere 3-hour buffer, which I declined.

What followed was completely unacceptable. Mr. Arman became verbally aggressive, refused to allow us into the room, and kept my elderly parents—who had just endured a 13-hour flight—waiting in the lobby for over 90 minutes. His justification was an alleged SOP and a potential ₹20,000 fine if guests stayed past noon, which I found to be completely baseless given the appalling condition of the hotel. I even offered to provide a written undertaking accepting any such penalty, but he refused.

I reluctantly agreed to pay 30–35% of the day’s tariff just to be allowed into the room. At that hour, with exhausted parents, I had no other option.

Upon entering the room, we were horrified. The room was in a deplorable state:

It reeked of cigarette smoke.
The bedding and towels were clearly used and unchanged.
The AC, TV, and geyser were non-functional.
Cockroaches were crawling around.
There was no running water in the washroom.

The only feedback I would give that they can make the menu in a more streamlined way like sometimes it felt very confusing like the arrangement of the menu is not done right and like we ordered from a-la-carte, don't know about thalis. But in a-la-carte many dishes were missing and Bengali and some other cuisines were jumbled up.

Quantity vs Price is also a concern like the portion sizes felt a bit small compared to the price.

These are the reasons why I gave one star less.

But but but, I recommend all to try the unique dishes. Like unlike traditional dishes I would recommend to go for the exclusive dishes which they have made like themselves. Because we tried traditional aloo dum and luchi it was mid but when we ordered the chingri pulao and the mutton egg bake - Oh my god! Like literally those were too good! Especially my personal recommendation will be the mutton egg bake, that's so flavourful and quantity, quality of the meat and overall it's just wonderful.

kol050,kol050_r1,Anagha Mani,2,"Honest Review

Stayed here for two nights with my family. I had called the hotel a day before our arrival to ensure everything would be comfortable. The staff on the call was polite and encouraged me to trust their hospitality, even mentioning that many of the negative reviews were from guests who didn’t get discounts. I decided to give them a chance.

The biggest plus is the location—it’s in a prime area, with easy access to major attractions, shops, and taxis. Very convenient, especially for tourists. The hospitality was also genuinely good. The reception and service staff were helpful, friendly, and responsive. When we asked for a late checkout due to a late-night flight, they allowed it smoothly with a ₹3000 fee, which we appreciated.

That said, the rooms were disappointing. We booked two rooms, and both were extremely small—barely any space to walk around. The property is old, and the rooms showed clear signs of neglect. They weren’t soundproof, and worst of all, they were very dusty and unclean when we checked in. We found hair on the bed and floor, stained bedsheets, dirty flooring, and a dusty fridge. Despite informing them in advance, the rooms weren’t ready.

To their credit, once we complained, a staff member promptly came, changed the bedding, and dusted the room. They even offered to clean it the next day, but we declined, knowing it wouldn't make much difference.

I chose this hotel only because I needed an Indian-style toilet for my parents—something hard to find in other hotels. So I can't entirely complain, but I wouldn't return unless absolutely necessary.

If you're traveling solo and on a tight budget, this might work for a quick stay. But for families or those expecting basic cleanliness, I wouldn’t recommend it. The service is excellent, but the cleanliness and value for money are major letdowns.

kol050,kol050_r2,Akib Khan,5,"I recently stayed at Hotel Afsha and overall had a decent experience. The location is quite convenient, especially if you’re staying in central Kolkata. The staff were polite and responsive, and check-in was smooth.

Rooms were clean and decently maintained, though they could use a bit of renovation to improve the overall feel. Wi-Fi speed was average and there were no major connectivity issues. One highlight was the in-room dining — food was fresh and reasonably priced.

However, the bathroom amenities were a bit basic, and soundproofing could definitely be better. If you’re a light sleeper, noise from nearby rooms or the corridor might disturb you.

Overall, it’s a good budget option if you’re looking for something central and functional.",2025-07-09T19:14:28.792234995Z,a month ago

Key areas such as Esplanade and Park Street are within walking distance from there. The primary issue lies with the staff members who escort you to your room, as they consistently asking tips (monetary compensation). I transported my own luggage to my room, yet he still requested a tip. Each time I placed an order, he would deduct a portion as his tip and then request additional compensation.

kol051,kol051_r3,Aman Gupta,1,"Disappointing Experience – Not Worth the Stay

I had a very disappointing experience at this hotel. First of all, they mentioned that a welcome drink would be provided on arrival, but it was never served.
The worst part of my stay was the breakfast mishap. I had specifically asked the staff to pack a vegetarian breakfast as I am a strict vegetarian. However, they packed a non-vegetarian sandwich without any label or indication. Trusting the hotel, I took a bite — only to realize something was off. When I checked with the staff, they casually admitted it was non-veg and simply said sorry. This is not just careless; it’s highly insensitive and unacceptable, especially for someone with dietary restrictions based on personal or religious reasons.
Additionally, the room was far from comfortable. There was no ventilation, and a strong smell of moisture lingered in the room, mattress, and even the comforter. It made the stay extremely unpleasant.
I would not recommend staying here, especially if you have specific dietary preferences or expect basic hygiene and comfort.",2025-07-19T02:50:08.508910667Z,a month ago

3. Unsanitary Kitchen Practices: The hotel’s kitchen is described as filthy, with stains from gutkha (chewing tobacco) spit observed in the premises. This creates an impression of a highly unprofessional and unhygienic environment, akin to a poorly maintained cow shed.

4. Food Quality Concerns: Guests are strongly advised not to order food from the hotel due to concerns over hygiene and cleanliness. This suggests a disregard for food safety standards.

However, the true highlight was the dining experience. The hotel’s restaurant - Zyqa was outstanding, offering a delectable array of dishes that celebrated both local flavors and global cuisine. Each meal was a delight, crafted with precision and served with finesse. Equally impressive was the in-room dining —prompt, efficient, and consistently delicious.

kol073,kol073_r2,Sandip Mondal,3,"Hotel Samrat (Esplanade)
I recently had the opportunity to stay at Hotel Samrat (Esplanade) for three days, occupying two different rooms. My experience was a mix of positives and negatives, which I'll outline in this review.

*Room 101: A Decent Option*
The first room I stayed in was Room 101, which cost Rs. 1100 per night for a double bed with AC. The room had a good view of the street, which was a pleasant surprise. However, I was disappointed to find that the room lacked even the most basic amenities like soap, towel, toothpaste, and handwash.

The room itself was spacious enough for two people, with a comfortable double bed and a small table. The AC worked well, which was a relief given the hot weather outside. However, the room could have benefited from better lighting, as it felt a bit dimly lit at times.

Despite the lack of amenities, Room 101 was a decent option for the price. However, I would have expected more in terms of basic toiletries and cleanliness.

*Room 4: A Disaster*
Unfortunately, my experience with Room 4, which cost Rs. 700 per night for a single bed without AC, was atrocious. The room was akin to a jail cell, with no window and poor network connectivity. The toilet was slippery, making it a safety hazard. Honestly, I wouldn't pay more than Rs. 400 for such a subpar room.

The room itself was tiny, with a single bed that felt like it was going to collapse under my weight. The bed sheets were dirty, and the pillow was flat and uncomfortable. There was no table or chair, making it difficult to work or relax.

The lack of AC was a major issue, given the hot weather outside. The room felt like an oven, making it difficult to sleep or relax. The slippery toilet was a major safety hazard, and I was worried about falling and injuring myself.

Overall, Room 4 was a disaster, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

*Silver Linings*
Despite the shortcomings, there were a few positives. The hotel offered free WiFi, which was a welcome convenience. The staff, particularly the eyeglass-wearing uncle and the young boy, were courteous and helpful.

The hotel's location was also a major plus, with several restaurants and shops within walking distance. The Esplanade area is a bustling commercial hub, with plenty of options for food, shopping, and entertainment.

*Receptionist: A Letdown*
Unfortunately, the receptionist was a major letdown. They were rude and uncooperative, making it difficult to check-in or resolve any issues. When I asked for a towel, they seemed put off, and when I requested a change of room, they were dismissive.

The receptionist's behavior was a major turn-off, and it made me wonder about the hotel's customer service standards. If the receptionist is the first point of contact for guests, it's essential that they are friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

*Verdict*
In conclusion, my experience at Hotel Samrat (Esplanade) was mediocre at best. While Room 101 was decent, Room 4 was a disaster. The staff, apart from the receptionist, were friendly and helpful.

If you're looking for a budget-friendly option for a short stay, Hotel Samrat might be tolerable. However, I wouldn't recommend it for an extended holiday. The lack of amenities, poor cleanliness, and rude receptionist make it a less-than-ideal choice.

Rating: 2.5/5

*Recommendation*
If you do decide to stay at Hotel Samrat, make sure to:

- Avoid Room 4 at all costs
- Carry your own toiletries and amenities
- Be prepared for a rude receptionist
- Take advantage of the free WiFi
- Explore the surrounding area for food, shopping, and entertainment options

By being aware of the hotel's shortcomings, you can make an informed decision and plan accordingly.

*Final Thoughts*
Hotel Samrat (Esplanade) has the potential to be a great budget-friendly option, but it falls short in several areas. With some improvements in cleanliness, amenities, and customer service, this hotel could be a top choice for travelers.

Until then, I would recommend exploring other options in the area. There are plenty of hotels and guesthouses that offer better value",2025-02-24T15:37:18.218600Z,6 months ago

kol085,kol085_r2,Sridhar,1,"I had a very disappointing experience with this hotel during my recent trip for a critical early morning US visa interview.

I had informed the hotel via WhatsApp that my flight was delayed and I would be arriving late—around midnight or early morning hours. I did get a response assuring me that the staff would be informed and I could check in anytime. Unfortunately, the reality was completely different.

I arrived at the hotel around 2:00 AM, only to find the main gate locked. I had to search for an alternate entrance and ended up waking a security guard who appeared to be fully intoxicated. The hotel itself was located on the third floor of a residential building and the main door was locked with iron grills.

Despite having two contact numbers listed on MakeMyTrip, nobody answered my calls, even after trying continuously for 15 minutes. I then reached out to MakeMyTrip customer support, who also tried for another 30 minutes, only to inform me they couldn’t help with the situation.

By the time I gave up, it was already 3:15 AM. I was stranded on the streets, exhausted, with no access to transport or alternative accommodation.

This experience was extremely distressing and unacceptable, especially considering I had booked and confirmed my stay in advance and had clearly communicated my late arrival. I sincerely hope the hotel takes serious note of this issue and ensures no future guest goes through a similar ordeal.",2025-04-24T12:59:44.186381Z,4 months ago

kol086,kol086_r3,DHARMENDRA KUMAR,1,"I rarely write reviews, but this experience was so overwhelmingly negative that I feel compelled to share the full extent of my frustration. To say I was disappointed would be a monumental understatement. This establishment has deteriorated beyond recognition. What was once a place I could recommend without hesitation has now become a place I wouldn’t suggest even to my worst enemy.

Let me start with the staff – and I use the term “staff” very loosely here, because what we encountered was a group of individuals who seem to have been trained in the art of maximum rudeness. They were VERY RUDE. VERY VERY VERY VERY RUDE. I cannot stress this enough. From the moment we walked in, it felt like we were a burden rather than guests. No greeting, no smile, no courtesy – just dismissive glares and snappy, condescending tones. Any simple request was met with eye rolls or outright ignoring us. It's one thing to be understaffed or busy, but it's an entirely different and unacceptable thing to treat paying customers with open hostility.

But sadly, the staff was just the beginning of the problem.

The overall quality of the experience has dropped off a cliff. Everything – and I mean EVERYTHING – has gone downhill. The atmosphere feels neglected, the cleanliness is questionable at best, and there’s a pervasive sense that no one cares anymore. What happened to the standards? What happened to pride in service?

Even something as simple as the welcome drinks, which used to be a lovely touch, has now become a joke. The variety has decreased dramatically – once a small but delightful detail that made the experience feel special, now reduced to bland, watered-down offerings that feel like an afterthought. What used to be five or six flavorful options has now been cut down to maybe two, and neither of them were palatable.

It honestly feels like management has completely given up. It’s as if they think no one will notice the decline, or worse – that no one cares. But I noticed. I cared. And I walked away from this visit feeling cheated, unwelcome, and genuinely upset that I spent my time and money here.",2025-05-18T09:09:01.948135Z,3 months ago

kol088,kol088_r5,Aneek Mandal,5,"It is going to be a fairly long review so bear along.

The moment one enters the hotel, it is simply impossible for the person to really grasp the scale of it.

We were greeted at the door by Ms/Mrs. Fulmoni who warmly welcomed us with arati. We checked in to our room and the entire process was very smooth. The room was very spacious and well furnished along with all the necessities. We also got some welcome chocolates which was tasty. The bathroom had good fittings. Didn't get an opportunity at an upgrade at this property, I believe it was thoroughly booked out.

After that we headed towards the in-house resturant East India Room for our lunch where we were really well attended to and taken care of by the manager Mr. Amrit Krishna Jena and Mr. Koushik. We were also visited by sous chef Ankur Halder who asked about our food preferences and suggested foods accordingly. The food was really really good except for the naan which I didn't really find as per my expectations. I also found it a bit off that a dessert was supposed to be shared by an entire family but I suppose that is the standard policy.

We then enjoyed a very cultural evening consisting of Puja arati and folk dance performance which was fabulously complimented with the ""cutting chai"" and Jhal Muri they served with their compliments. Mr. Chandan really attended us well and gave as an extra chai with ginger, which was nice.

After that we headed to the bar The Swig where I had one of the best cocktails ever, named Mojito 54. It was so good. I can't emphasize enough how much one should try it. Thanks to the bartender!

Next morning, we got a guided tour of the entire 13.5 acre property from Ms/Mrs. Paromita which was excellent, just excellent. She thoroughly explained the entirety of the property and the reasons behind certain designs and other minute details.

I also had a word with a manager and chef none of whose name I recall regarding the naan and they explained why it was the way it was.

Mr. Raj at reception shared a heartfelt goodbye along with his other colleagues whom I mentioned before and we clicked some memorable photos as well. It was really nice but I won't be attaching those to respect their privacy.

Even apart from the humble gentlemen and gentlewomen I mentioned in my review there were many others who made our stay really really great.

Now let's break down some of my likes and bit of my dislikes:

Likes:
1. A really secluded and nested away property which doesn't get many fly-by guests so it is peaceful.
2. One of the best hotel services I've ever experienced, definitely in my top ten as of now.
3. Well maintained and clean rooms.
4. Flute in the morning is absolutely awesome.
5. Good spread for breakfast.
6. Attention to detail.

Dislikes:
1. Extremely limited set menu option, and I mean extremely limited.
2. One dessert for three people to share.
3. Naan is not the typical Mughal Naan we are mostly accustomed to.
4. Really small pool.
5. The bathing area could have been entirely closed off with a glass door from the rest of the bathroom.
6. The complimentary sides served with the cocktail wasn't good.

Overall even though there are other hotels I would choose for rooms and other restaurants I would prefer to East India Room, I would select this hotel in a heartbeat simply for their attentive service!",2025-08-24T11:39:21.944184533Z,a week ago

Our recent stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing. The quality of food and service was far below expectations. There was neither proper food nor proper service throughout our stay. Shockingly, the entire hotel had only one chef, which clearly reflected in the poor meal management.

During breakfast, one day we were served idly without sambar, and on the next day, there was sambar but no idly or vada. Such inconsistency in basic food items is unacceptable, especially for business travelers or group bookings.

Talking about the food. It was finger licking good. I really enjoyed the food here and kept ordering as you can see in the photos.

First day order was - veg pulao and dal tadka in lunch. The taste was really good.
Evening time ordered masala tea and crispy chilli chicken. Loved it.
The tea was okay.

Second day order for lunch - chicken tandoori, mix veg and roti
Chicken tandoori was soft juicy tender perfectly cooked, taste was really nice.
Mix veg 10/10

I must say they about the quantity of the food, one plate order is enough for two adults.

The only drawback was the safety, as the window gets open if you want to smoke you can do that there but they doesn't have any safety grill. Have to be careful if you are with children.

It's centrally located in main road but once you get inside the room it's quiet because of the sound proof windows.

The check in and check out was hassle free. Doesn't have to wait.

I booked it through clear trip in an offer so we got the room for Rs 5609 including tax for 2 nights. And including food the total amount was upto Rs 9600 approx.

kol091,kol091_r1,Ayan Sarkar,2,"⭐ Rating: 2/5

Location and Rooms: 👍
The only two saving graces of Hotel Monotel are its proximity to Sector V metro station and the room aesthetics, which are reasonably comparable to a typical 3 or 4-star hotel.

Food and Service: 👎
The room service food was very underwhelming—it genuinely felt like something you'd get from a random street vendor, just served on a fancy plate. To make things worse, the staff kept insisting on payment immediately after every order, despite clearly requesting to settle all bills during checkout. It felt quite unprofessional.

Staff Behavior and Facilities: 🚩

The staff’s attitude was borderline rude. Even asking for basic things like tea or coffee sachet refills was treated as a major favor, complete with eye rolls and ""didn't we already give you in the morning?"" interrogations. Totally unnecessary and uncomfortable.

On top of that, most of the staff walk around with expressionless faces, avoiding eye contact as if hoping no one asks them for help. It genuinely felt like they just didn’t want to work or be bothered.

Check-in and check-out were delayed without any valid reason. We were the only guests at the reception during both times, yet it felt like they were doing us a favor by processing our request.

Elevators were non-functional at least four times during our short 2-night stay. Once, both elevators were down, forcing us to climb five floors with our luggage.

The gym is a joke—tiny space, outdated machines, and a dangerous treadmill with a slippery and broken surface. Honestly, it's a safety hazard. (Pictures attached). Even few attachments are broken.

Final verdict:
While the location and room aesthetics are decent, the overall experience was frustrating and far from what you'd expect at this price point. With poor staff attitude, unreliable facilities, and questionable food quality, I cannot recommend this hotel unless major improvements are made.",2025-07-27T13:26:15.996752930Z,a month ago

kol094,kol094_r2,Surojit Mahanta,1,"Extremely Disappointing Stay at Hotel MB International

I recently had the misfortune of staying at Hotel MB International, and it was, without a doubt, one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever endured. From the moment I arrived, everything went downhill, and I regret every penny spent on this so-called ""hotel.""

Filthy and Cramped Room

The room itself was a complete letdown. It was tiny, cramped, and smelled like it hadn’t been aired out in months. The carpet was stained with who-knows-what, and there were visible dust and grime on the furniture. The bed was uncomfortable, with sheets that looked like they hadn’t been changed in days. I even found stray hairs and crumbs on the pillowcases—disgusting! The bathroom was no better; the sink was clogged, the shower had mold in the corners, and the towels were threadbare and stained. It felt more like a rundown motel than a hotel.

Broken Amenities

As for the amenities, they were either broken or non-existent. The air conditioning barely worked, leaving the room stuffy and unbearable, especially during the night. The TV had only a few channels, and the remote was missing half its buttons. The Wi-Fi was so slow it was practically unusable, and when I called the front desk to complain, they simply said, ""We’ll look into it,"" but nothing was ever fixed. The mini-fridge in the room was warm, and the coffee maker looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages. It was clear that maintenance is not a priority here.

In summary, Hotel MB International is a complete disaster. The staff is unprofessional, the rooms are filthy and poorly maintained, the amenities are broken, the food is terrible, and the location is awful. I strongly advise against staying here—there are far better options out there, even on a budget. Save yourself the frustration and avoid this place at all costs.",2025-07-07T16:49:34.765146734Z,2 months ago

kol095,kol095_r4,Ishtiaque Chowdhury,1,"My recent experiences at sapphire suits left me with mixed feelings. During my first stay on June 6th, we encountered issues right from check-in. Despite booking a couple's room, we were informed that only twin beds were available and were offered an ""upgrade"" to a supposedly higher category room. However, upon entering the room, we were greeted by a strong, unpleasant odor, and the supposed upgrade felt more like a downgrade with outdated amenities that didn't match the advertised four-star standard.

Disappointed but hopeful for a better experience, we decided to give the hotel another chance and booked a higher category room for June 9th. Upon arrival in the morning, we requested to drop off our luggage early and were met with a tedious check-in process that involved multiple forms, passport submissions, and unnecessary delays. Despite our explicit request for a fresh and clean room, upon returning later in the evening, we were shocked to find blood-stained towels in the bathroom, indicating a serious lack of hygiene and attention to detail on the part of the housekeeping staff.

The overall service and standards of cleanliness observed during both stays fell far short of what one would expect from a four-star hotel. It's concerning that such basic standards of hygiene and customer service were not met, and it leaves me questioning the validity of the hotel's star rating. I've attached photos and videos to provide a visual representation of my experience, including the unpleasant odor in the room and the blood-stained towels.
In conclusion, while the hotel may boast a higher star rating, my experiences suggest otherwise. I hope this review serves as constructive feedback for the management to address these issues and improve the overall guest experience.

The window panes were broken in AC rooms. Rain was seeping in and when we informed the receptionist he told us it is only because it is raining and water won’t come inside otherwise.

No welcome kit was given and the bathrooms were not cleaned recently. The bathroom doors had no proper lock. You open one tap and water comes from every other faucets. Water was not available after 12AM almost every night we stayed there.

I have stayed there with my partner and the bedsheet they provided was extremely dirty When we raised a complaint and asked to change it they said that they do not have a bedsheet .. As the payment was done, we were forced to stay for 2 days with the dirty bed sheet.. That's not the end, there was no water in the hotel for 4 hours so we had to go to our own home to freshen up.  Next time I went there with my partner on 2nd August and they provided a clean bedsheet but as I had gifted my partner a flower bouquet so somehow rosepatel stain got into the bedsheet and the blanketcover so at the time of checkout they held us for 2 hours and charged an extra 1500 from us, we have informed them if they wash the bedsheet then the stain will go away and we agreed to pay the charges for the dry cleaning as well but they are overconfident enough and said it will not go even after the dry cleaning so they asked us to take he bedsheet and cover and if the stain will remove after the dry cleaning they will return the money so at the end i had to book a dry cleaning and they came for pick up and confirm that stain will be removed and will be washed and deliver within 3-4 days.. After that, they have charged an extra 1500 from us even after paying for the. Dry cleaning.. On 8th August I got the bedsheet and all the stain was removed so I called the owner on 8th Aug to share the details and the experience and the harassment we had faced but the owner picked up the call after calling him more than 20 times.. He asked me to share the details and proof on WhatsApp and and asked to come with the bedsheet on 9th Aug to discuss the issue but the owner did not come and i was keep geeting multiple calls from the reception to return the bedsheet so i called owner again15-20 times but he didn't picked up the call so i went to the hotel to return the bedsheet and get my money back so the cleaning person comes and check that the stain was removed and now he is trying to create another Sean of quality issue of the bedsheets after the dry ceaning and trust me the bedsheet was looking new and cleaner than they have provided in the day of checking.. I had to go to my work and they were having a delay and calling people so that they could create a new issue and not have to return my money.. It was been 10-15 minutes i was setting there and watching them so as i was getting late for my work so i have asked them that what they think about the value of my time and the cleaning parson and receptionist lady started shouting at me and the cleaning person commented that “App Kya yahapr achha kaam Karen aaate ho” .. I have not broken any law and I have come with my partner with both consent and we both are adults.. He has no right to make a statement like this and why are they providing rooms to the adults then?? Who the hell is he gonna tell me whatever doing wrong or right? .. Fortunately, I have recorded the video of the moment he made the statement and he also threatened me at the beginning which will lead to a police complaint.. You all can see the video, he was rude and aggressive, and the gesture of his body and the tone of his voice.. Today is 10th Aug and I'm going to the police station to complain about the hotel.. At the end, they have returned the money like they are doing a favour for me.. This is a mental harassment and how come they have stated this kind of statement? After this incident, I have called the hotel owner again to make a complaint but he is not receiving my calls and he is not seeing my text.. All the proof has been attached.. So make your decision before you go to this hotel cause you will get multiple good hotels in this location.. We are all paying for the stay for a good experience and a pleasant stay after this it’s a nightmare for me. I suggest everyone, go and book another hotel for your stay cause I believe no one wants to have this kind of experience and embarrassment in front of the camera or in front of multiple people.",2025-08-10T04:09:00.366906763Z,3 weeks ago

kol098,kol098_r4,Shaik Rabbi Hossain,1,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent stay at one of your properties, an experience that was not only inconvenient but utterly unacceptable for any guest, let alone a family traveling with a young child.

Upon arrival, we were shockingly denied check-in despite having a confirmed booking. The staff attempted to charge us more than the agreed booking amount, causing a needless and frustrating delay of over an hour before the matter was reluctantly resolved after multiple calls to customer support. A so-called “complimentary coupon” was issued as a makeshift apology, but it did little to compensate for the humiliation and inconvenience faced.

To make matters worse, the property lacked even the most basic facility of a working card machine. I was forced to leave my family behind and walk 500 meters to withdraw cash from an ATM — a completely avoidable inconvenience had the hotel been properly equipped.

The room condition was beyond disappointing.
•	The bedsheets were visibly stained, smelled foul, and were clearly unwashed.
•	The bathroom door creaked and screeched loudly, creating a genuinely unsettling environment.
•	In place of proper bathing amenities, there was a cheap handwash liquid provided for bathing — no soap, no shower gel, absolutely nothing appropriate.
•	The water flow in the bathroom was painfully slow, making something as simple as taking a shower an ordeal that tested our patience.

In short, this experience was a complete disaster.
It is disgraceful that a brand that claims to offer standardized stays across India delivers such substandard, unhygienic, and utterly careless service.

I will never stay at any Oyo property again and will strongly advise friends, family, and colleagues to avoid Oyo, especially this particular location. No customer, especially those traveling with children, should have to endure such an appalling experience.

I urge Oyo management to take immediate and serious corrective actions — not just superficial apologies, but real accountability measures to ensure no other customer is subjected to such blatant disregard for basic hospitality standards.",2025-04-26T12:25:37.215006Z,4 months ago

Firstly, the hotel provided us with a torn pillow cover — something no decent hotel should ever do. But what shocked us more was what happened during checkout. Our car was stopped by the staff, and we were told they wanted to verify whether the pillow cover was already torn or if it was damaged by us. This was completely disrespectful and humiliating.

If you’re giving damaged items to your guests in the first place, how can you later question them about it?

It’s now very clear that their so-called polite behaviour is just a show to attract customers. They seriously lack understanding of customer service and relationship management. The staff’s attitude and overall behaviour this time were completely different and unprofessional.

**********
I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent stay of my guests at your hotel from 28 th November,2024 late evening to 30th November 12 noon. I had reserved 07 Rooms on 28th and additional 10 Rooms on 29th, a total of 24 Rooms. Despite your establishments reputation, the services offered during their stay were far from satisfactory. All the rooms were in an  unhygienic condition and had various maintenance issues that reflected negligence.
Again, I express my extreme disappointment with the level of customer service they received during their stay. The issues they encountered during their stay were extremely unacceptable.
The reasons for the stay was pertaining to my son's Wedding Reception  at Tolly Club, which is near to the Hotel. As maximum guests were from the Bride's side, I felt absolute guilty after their various complaints.
Even the Manager at the counter had ill behaved with the guests to accommodate them, even they carried their valid I cards,,,yes it was a bit late to produce.
As such, I'm sorry to state that due to the issues cited above, I am compelled to file a complaint against the hotel in MOT (Ministry of Tourism).
And kindly note that even the complaints  from my guests, I never requested for a concession as the reservation was in bulk.

PLEASE DONOT STAY HERE, IT'S A SCAM HOTEL
THE HOTEL SHOULD THANK ME FOR NOT FILING ANY COMPLAINT
TO THE NEARBY POLICE STATION; should have done that, I regret now.

We have booked rooms for 2 days on 18th and 19th July directly, not through any website.
Went there with my 2 kids for travel purpose seeing the good reviews of this hotel.
We had horrible experience on both the days but on the 2nd day it was beyond imagination.
* Firstly the rooms are exceptionally small and we've opted for double bed which they joined badly that entire night my child would slip in between the beds.
* So, I asked them to change the room and they shifted us to the 6th floor; that too for shifting they made us to sit for more than an hour. That time there was no electricity and I had to knock them continuously as I had to move from the hotel due to some other commitments.
* The room which they gave after waiting for so long, water leaked continuously from the AC.
Since after shifting we didn't notice the leakage, so once we were back to hotel we saw pool of water nearby the bed.
after complaining they sent a boy of the hotel who checked the AC and said ice has formed inside the AC and they cannot do anything unless they call a technician the next day.
* They put several towels over the water and after that the AC was not working.
Even after repeated complaints, they didn't listen and we had to sleep without the AC even after paying for the AC room.
Imagine our condition, in such a humid weather we were stuck in a room without AC and there was no fan atall.
But on the 1st day, there was a fan in the 3rd floor room.
Entire night we were awake and the apology we got from them was a 'SORRY'...
My question is if the AC was not working, why they have shifted us, it's just because of the fact, we had made all the payments earlier, this is the customer service or the customer satisfaction they gave us.
If I would have stayed for one more day, I would have complaint to the Police Station regarding their pathetic service.

kol119,kol119_r1,nishal lama,1,"A Truly Dismal Stay: A Warning to Future Guests
My recent stay at this hotel was, without exaggeration, one of the most frustrating and disappointing hotel experiences I have ever endured. What began with the promise of a comfortable retreat quickly devolved into a series of baffling inconveniences and outright poor service that left a truly bitter taste. I feel compelled to share my experience in detail, not out of spite, but to genuinely caution others considering this establishment.

From the moment I arrived, issues began to surface. There was a significant discrepancy in the tariff from what I had been quoted during booking. What should have been a straightforward check-in became a drawn-out debate, with staff seemingly unwilling or unable to clarify the charges. This initial hurdle, while annoying, paled in comparison to the ordeal that followed.

The most egregious example of the hotel's utter lack of customer understanding occurred early one morning. At approximately 5 AM, I found myself in a desperate situation: needing to make a payment, I was informed that the hotel would not accept UPI payment. In an era where digital transactions are the norm, especially for convenience, this was a shocking revelation. What made it worse was the complete absence of any practical alternatives or solutions offered by the staff. Instead, I was curtly directed to an ATM – a destination that, I soon discovered, was a 20-minute walk away.

Imagine the scenario: 5 AM, in an unfamiliar city, being forced to trek a significant distance just to access my own money, all because the hotel was unwilling or unable to adapt to modern payment methods or provide a reasonable workaround. This wasn't just inconvenient; it felt like a deliberate disregard for guest comfort and safety. There was no offer of a temporary solution, no suggestion of nearby alternatives, and certainly no apology for the immense trouble I was being put through.

This incident highlighted a pervasive issue: a severe deficiency in customer service. It became painfully clear that the managers knew nothing about customer service. Interactions with the management were met with a baffling lack of empathy and an almost robotic adherence to rigid, inconvenient policies. There was no sense of problem-solving, no willingness to go the extra mile, and certainly no genuine concern for guest satisfaction. It felt as though their primary goal was to process transactions rather than ensure a pleasant stay. Every request or query, no matter how simple, seemed to be met with resistance or a perfunctory, unhelpful response.
In summary, my experience at this hotel was a cascade of letdowns: from unexpected tarif hikes to an astonishingly archaic payment policy that forced a pre-dawn marathon to find an ATM. The fundamental lack of service, particularly from the management, was truly astounding. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a hassle-free or even marginally comfortable stay. There are countless other establishments that understand the basic tenets of hospitality; this is not one of them. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere.",2025-07-13T00:53:12.001397894Z,a month ago

I recently had the pleasure of staying at Gulshan Inn, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience from start to finish.

The room was spotlessly clean, with fresh linens, plush pillows, and a cozy bed that ensured a great night’s sleep.

The attention to detail was impeccable – from the soft lighting to the well-stocked minibar and complimentary amenities. The bathroom was luxurious, featuring a spacious shower with excellent water pressure, high-quality toiletries, and fluffy towels that made the experience feel like a spa retreat.

One of the highlights of my stay was the breathtaking view from the window, which added an extra layer of relaxation to the experience. The room was also incredibly quiet, allowing for uninterrupted rest after a long day of exploring.

The staff at Gulshan Inn went above and beyond to make sure my stay was perfect. Their hospitality and professionalism were top-notch, always ready to assist with a smile.

And they given us room  worth of Rs 1900 in Rs 2200.and there were no other rooms at that time so we had to shift in that. But next day the other staff had provided us standard room at earlier confirmed price of Rs.1600. we stayed  there for 3 nights and 4 days and it was a pleasant expirence. Basic amenities and Service  is good, helpful staffs.my suggestion, water bottle should be provided free of cost as there were no other source of drinking water. otherwise a good hotel must consider for next trip 😊",2025-03-18T11:31:32.861648Z,5 months ago

If these issues are fixed, then there's no reason to complaint, according to me. As I mentioned, it is a good budget friendly option, especially for couples. The best feature of this Hotel is its Great Location. It is located right at the Heart of Chandni Market and is about a three minutes walk from Chandni Chowk Metro Gate Number 3.

After raising concerns on room pictures, hygiene, ratings and reviews , I was made to send mails , wasting close to an hour with 2 different service desk personnel. Initially, given the false hope of resolution of relocating to a different hotel but later to my disappointment shared an excuse of no issue found. It is very clear beyond any doubt that OYO partners are not maintaining the standard and uploading photoshopped photos in the site. If OYO is not taking care of it, it is the loss of brand OYO.The actual property(more than 5-6 pictures) shared are far from what is shown in the site. I am writing this feedback even though i will have to travel 6-7 hours later but left with no other option but to cancel my booking with oyo. After this, I don't have much to say even if the entire booking amount(which I paid in advance in spite of being optional at the time of booking trusting OYO brand) is cancelled. Leaves a really bad experience. Not using OYO again.

--------------------update-------------------------------

even after sharing all details, no action from oyo rooms side. not using it ever again. Will suggest others to be careful too, Better to not use oyo and even if you do never go for advance booking especially with oyo as these are not managed by oyo directly. you will end up getting last minute inconvenience.",2025-06-29T15:55:05.897501943Z,2 months ago

Additionally, the amenities in the rooms are in poor condition, with many items broken and the walls exhibiting water damage.

Given my experiences, I would rate my stay a 1 out of 5. I have noticed that the charges for my stay have varied between 1200 and 1300, while I believe the room price should be more in the range of 800-900. Furthermore, the location of the hotel is not ideal.

On a positive note, I would like to commend one staff member who was very understanding and helpful. He provided an option for online payment.

2. The staff/manager assured to direct me over a text message but did not care enough to send a message or the location. Had to walk around with luggage to find it.
4. The female dorm has no locks, lockers had no locks. Absolutely no privacy or safety for women travelers.
5. Bathrooms are common for both male and female, very dirty. Spotted a random middle aged man standing in front of the bathroom staring outside and doing nothing. Did not even use the bathroom or the wash basin. It was a nightmare.
6. Bedsheet and blankets were dirty. Took a towel on rent with additional pay. Was handed a used towel which was smelly and wet.

Overall it was a terrible experience and being a traveler and hostel owner myself it was very evident that these guys do not make any effort to make the experience of the travelers good.

2. The entrance to the Hotel is as disgusting as it could get. I am no kidding. The place is in the middle of a garbage dumping area and would make you want to puke.
3. The entire place, the room, the corridor, everything is congested and utterly dirty and unhygienic.

If you want to stay exactly 30 seconds from Chandni Chowk Metro Station (Gate No. 6), congrats — you’ve found the epicenter of convenience. But once you check in, don’t expect the Ritz. Expect... well, Margaret.

🛌 The rooms? Spacious-ish.
🚿 The bathroom? Works. Most days.
🧽 Cleanliness? Let's say the sheets told stories of the guests before me.
🔔 Staff? Helpful if you catch them between tea breaks and mood swings.
🧳 Elevator? Haha what elevator? Enjoy the cardio if your room's on the 3rd floor.

Now, to be fair — it’s budget-friendly, doesn’t pretend to be 5-star, and if all you want is a place to crash after stuffing your face at Nizam’s or exploring Esplanade, this place gets the job done. No frills, no fuss — just walls, a bed, and some character-building surprises.

Pro tip: Carry your own bedsheet, a powerbank, and maybe a mosquito repellent... you know, just in case Margaret gets wild at night.

I had one of the worst hotel experiences of my life at FabHotel Lake Side View, Topsia between 9th to 13th July — and as a hotelier with over 25 years in the hospitality industry, I’ve never witnessed such unprofessionalism and outright rude, intimidating behavior.

Despite having paid in full, well in advance, the front desk staff hesitated to hand over the room upon arrival at 9:00 PM — which is well past standard check-in time. Initially, we were given a room that was unclean and clearly not ready. After waiting for an entire hour, the counter staff admitted they had already allotted our confirmed room to someone else. I witnessed them repeatedly call the person occupying OUR room, asking them to vacate it ASAP.

I reached out to the FAB Helpline twice, only to be met with a confusing and broken IVR system. Finally, a customer care executive assured me that our room was indeed confirmed and we only needed to collect the keys from the reception. She even called the hotel directly to confirm — only for the hotel staff to shamelessly deny the whole situation.

When I confronted the staff, they suddenly handed me a different room key — something they could’ve done an hour earlier. But what followed next was completely unacceptable:

The receptionist turned aggressive, warning me in a threatening tone, “This is Kolkata, you can do whatever you want. Jo ukhaadna hai ukhaad lo, koi farak nahi padta.”

This kind of rowdy street-level intimidation is beyond disgraceful, especially in the hospitality industry.

Shocking. Unprofessional. Unsafe.

If this is the level of service and behavior FAB allows under its brand name, it seriously raises concerns about the quality control and accountability within their network.

STAY AWAY from this hotel if you value your time, safety, and basic hospitality standards.",2025-07-09T16:00:34.446306599Z,a month ago

kol146,kol146_r2,Raushan Kumar,1,"Absolutely Disappointed – Viceroy Has Hit Rock Bottom

This was our fourth and final time booking at Viceroy, and I can confidently say the experience has gone from average to utterly unacceptable. The food quality has drastically deteriorated since our second visit, which is inexcusable for a hotel that still dares to charge premium prices.

This time, we made two separate bookings for two guests each, and while one of them clearly had breakfast included, we were wrongly charged for it. When we pointed out the mistake, stating that they had taken the wrong room number into account, the lady at the front desk responded rudely and unprofessionally. Her exact words were:
“Aami kichu korte parbo na ek baar bill hoyegelle” (Translation: “I can’t do anything once the bill is made”).

This is absolutely unacceptable customer service. No apology, no attempt to rectify the mistake – just a dismissive attitude and a shrug.

Clearly, the hotel staff is poorly trained, and their attitude reflects a complete lack of accountability or respect for repeat customers. We were not just disappointed – we felt cheated.

After this experience, we will never book Viceroy again, and I strongly urge others to think twice before trusting their money and expectations with this place. It’s no longer what it used to be – and unless they fix their service quality and basic courtesy, it’s only going to get worse.",2025-08-03T07:38:54.154187251Z,a month ago
kol146,kol146_r3,Raushan Singh,1,"Avoid at All Costs – Hotel Viceroy Is a Complete Disgrace

Let me make it very clear: Hotel Viceroy is no longer a place for decent hospitality – it is an establishment plagued by arrogance, incompetence, and outright customer exploitation. After four stays, I can confidently say this hotel has deteriorated beyond recovery.

We made two separate bookings for two guests each. One booking included breakfast – the other didn’t. Yet, we were shamelessly overcharged, and when we pointed out their error, what we received in return was not just negligence, but blatant disrespect.

The woman at the reception had zero professionalism and spoke in a tone that was casual, dismissive, and rude. Her exact words were:
“Aami kichu korte parbo na ek baar bill hoyegelle.”
Which translates to: “I can’t do anything once the bill is made.”

Excuse me? So a hotel of this scale believes that once they make a mistake and print a bill, they are absolved of all responsibility? This isn't just a billing error—it's a reflection of the deep-rooted mismanagement and rotting customer service culture here.

The Problems Run Deep:

Dishonest Billing: Charging guests wrongly and refusing to fix the error.

Terrible Attitude: The front desk staff has no training, empathy, or manners.

Food Quality = Disaster: Once decent, the food now tastes like it came from a third-rate street vendor.

Management is Non-existent: No one steps up, no one listens. Complaints are tossed aside like garbage.

Zero Accountability: They treat guests like fools who should “adjust” with whatever garbage service they feel like offering.

Let me be very honest: Viceroy is running on its past reputation, and if they keep treating guests like this, that reputation will crumble very soon – as it should.

As a frequent traveler, I’ve stayed in all kinds of hotels. But this experience was beyond frustrating—it was insulting.
We were not just ignored, we were cheated and then made to feel like we were the problem.

Final Verdict:

If you value your money, time, and basic dignity – STAY AWAY from Viceroy.
They do not deserve your business.
And if the management has any integrity left, they should start by firing staff who can't speak respectfully to guests and fix their broken systems before more people walk away forever.",2025-08-03T07:47:24.303546894Z,a month ago

kol146,kol146_r5,Pushpanjay Kumar,1,"Pathetic Experience – Viceroy is a Total Disaster Now

I am absolutely appalled at how far Hotel Viceroy has fallen. This was our FOURTH stay—and definitely the LAST. What was once a decent hotel has now become a shameful mess of mismanagement, arrogance, and zero accountability.

We had two separate bookings (2 persons each). One included breakfast, the other didn’t. Despite clear booking confirmation, they wrongly billed us for breakfast that was already included. When we flagged the error, instead of correcting their mistake, the front desk staff (a lady with no basic manners or training) told us bluntly:
“Aami kichu korte parbo na ek baar bill hoyegelle.”
Translation: “Once the bill is made, I can’t do anything.”

That’s not just poor service—it’s wilful fraud and sheer disrespect toward paying guests. No apology. No resolution. Just a smug, careless attitude.

This is not a hotel anymore – it’s a scam in disguise.
The food quality is disgusting now, a shadow of what it used to be. It’s obvious they’ve cut corners everywhere – from the kitchen to the front desk to the management’s sense of responsibility.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Viceroy doesn’t care about guests. They lie, overcharge, and behave as if they’re doing you a favor.

If the management is reading this (which I doubt, given their ignorance), know this:
You’ve just lost a loyal customer forever, and I’ll make sure others know exactly how pathetic this place has become.",2025-08-03T07:41:48.779850571Z,a month ago

kol147,kol147_r2,Karan Singh,5,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Opus Boutique Hotel in Kolkata, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish! The rooms were impeccably clean, with every corner spotless and well-maintained, making it a comfortable and refreshing retreat after a long day. The attention to detail in keeping the space tidy really stood out and added to the overall charm of this boutique gem.

The hotel staff were exceptional—warm, welcoming, and always ready to assist with a smile. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone was incredibly polite and attentive, ensuring all my needs were met promptly and with genuine care. It’s rare to find such a dedicated team that makes you feel so at home.

One of the best parts about The Opus is how affordable it is for the quality you get. The prices are incredibly reasonable, offering fantastic value for a boutique hotel in the heart of Kolkata. It’s the perfect choice for travelers looking for comfort without breaking the bank.

And the food—oh, the food was simply amazing! The on-site restaurant served up a variety of dishes that were bursting with flavor, from local delicacies to international options. Every meal I had was delicious, well-presented, and left me looking forward to the next. The breakfast spread was a highlight, with fresh and tasty choices that set the tone for the day.

Overall, The Opus Boutique Hotel is a fantastic find in Kolkata. Clean rooms, friendly staff, affordable rates, and incredible food make it a standout choice.

This used to be a hotel with a great reputation, offering a charming vibe and ambience, but unfortunately, it seems they have completely neglected the upkeep of the property.

Upon arrival, we were given a room with a rusted iron lock on the door, and once inside, the situation only got worse. There was visible water seepage all around the walls and even under the bed, which was absolutely unacceptable. To make matters worse, there were cigarette butts left from previous guests, showing a complete lack of attention to room hygiene and cleanliness.

The shower didn't work properly, and overall, the room was not cleaned to any reasonable standard. For the price they charge, the level of service and maintenance is nowhere near acceptable. On top of that, the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful, which only added to the negative experience.
