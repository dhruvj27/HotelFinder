To start with I must complement Abhijeet who made our stay worth while with all the help.\nFirstly, we got a room which were not renovated but still had the heritage feeling to it. Deal breaker was the washroom, the toilet seat was soo old and dirty with stains and the shower was just taking it's last breath. We were so disappointed that we had to ask for a room change and I must say it was promptly done.\nThe staff was always courteous and  keen to help.\nNext day we went for breakfast buffet, and I must say it had nothing Taj about it. The spread wasn't that great and some of the stuff they made didn't tingle my tastebuds either. That was the most disappointing thing of our stay.\nI must say at the cost of repetition the staff ( esp Mr Abhijeet) was truly Taj like and offered great help.\nMy feedback would be to enhance the buffet spreads and check quality control for the taste of cuisine. Also I see that renovation is in progress so I presume toilets and showers will get better after that.\nI really didn't find it my moneys worth this time but hopefully they will improve.

This setup felt extremely questionable and gives the impression the hotel is avoiding its Booking.com commitments.\n\nAt midnight, loud music started from one of the rooms. I complained at 12:20 am.

For three hours of disruption and stress, her absence and lack of responsibility were unacceptable.\n\nThe problems didn\u2019t stop there. At breakfast, there was a 25-minute queue while staff stood distracted on their phones. Only after guests made noise were we redirected to another restaurant. Later, my new room access was locked because the night-shift staff forgot to update the system.\n\nWhen I raised concerns, duty manager Mohitri attempted to \u201ccalm me down\u201d by sharing irrelevant personal stories about her own divorce even wrongly assuming I was divorced. As a solo woman traveler, this was not only unprofessional but also extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThis property is far below expected standards.

Each evening as I would return from work, I would quickly stop by the bar to order a drink to be delivered to the smoking lounge where I would relax with a cigar.  After only one day, Rick fully understood my routine and would always prepare the most delicious Old Fashioned I have had in quite some time.  Rick would see that my drink was delivered and that the staff would check on me for any refills.  Rick stands out to me as a great employee who is focused on the satisfaction of those he serves.

They claimed our Booking.com reservation was cancelled and the only way to stay was to pay double the price upfront for a lower tier room. This was at 10.30PM so there was obviously no other real choice, which the staff member understood. At first the staff member claimed the hotel was fully sold out before claiming one room was available for double the price. This was clearly a scam.\n\nOur room was a non smoking room. However, the room had an extremely heavy stench of smoke, and several cigarette burn marks.\n\nThere was a very long hair inside the bed. No one staying at the room had this long of hair, or this colour, so it can only lead you to believe they did not clean the bed.\n\nThe bed had three large stains on the sheets.\n\nThe shower was extremely dirty, with soap stains and hair from previous guests all over the place.\n\nThe room was extremely loud throughout the night, and in the morning with music / construction work.\n\nThe rooms are very dated and in need of maintenance. Things are held together with masking tape and poorly cleaned.\n\nThe WiFi did not work. Upon calling the front desk for assistance, we were met with a very rude and unhelpful staff member, who was dismissive. So, we did not have any WiFi during the stay.\n\nIf the hotel was half the price, it may be worth it. Otherwise, do not bother booking here. The city has much better to offer for similar / cheaper prices.",

We were given a lower category room than what we booked (luckily the type of room was printed in the registration form).  Only after we asked about this did the front office night manager give the reasoning that because the hotel was fully booked they had to do this.  So we were downgraded with no recourse, but since it was past midnight, we thought to take it up with front office manager in the morning.\n\nNow for the part of our HORRENDOUS experience, the Front Office Manager, this gentleman was not even willing to listen to, or to look at the documents. His position was that as a Guest, we cannot understand what happened.  After showing him the photograph of the reservation form & registration form, he started flailing and shouting in an even higher tone. Luckily, the acting Hotel manager. Mr Sunayan was there to clear this issue with all the grace and hospitality that the Lalit Grant Eastern has always been known for. If it was not for Mr. Sunayan and the amazing staff at the Lalit, I think our trip would have been ruined. If the Hotel would like the name of the front office manager, please do let me know.\nAs for Mr. Sunayan, no words can express the relief of sanity and level of service he provided. The Executive Sous Chef, Mr Krishan Chaddha, made sure our FNB experience was amazing.\n\nWith the history I have shared with the Lalit, it would have been a sad ending if not for the service recovery by Mr Sunayan and his team.  Thank you.\nI have deducted one star from Service, for the attitude of your front office manager.",

We checked in to our room and the entire process was very smooth. The room was very spacious and well furnished along with all the necessities. We also got some welcome chocolates which was tasty. The bathroom had good fittings. Didn't get an opportunity at an upgrade at this property, I believe it was thoroughly booked out.\n\nAfter that we headed towards the in-house resturant East India Room for our lunch where we were really well attended to and taken care of by the manager Mr. Amrit Krishna Jena and Mr. Koushik. We were also visited by sous chef Ankur Halder who asked about our food preferences and suggested foods accordingly. The food was really really good except for the naan which I didn't really find as per my expectations. I also found it a bit off that a dessert was supposed to be shared by an entire family but I suppose that is the standard policy.\n\nWe then enjoyed a very cultural evening consisting of Puja arati and folk dance performance which was fabulously complimented with the \"cutting chai\" and Jhal Muri they served with their compliments. Mr. Chandan really attended us well and gave as an extra chai with ginger, which was nice.\n\nAfter that we headed to the bar The Swig where I had one of the best cocktails ever, named Mojito 54. It was so good. I can't emphasize enough how much one should try it. Thanks to the bartender!\n\nNext morning, we got a guided tour of the entire 13.5 acre property from Ms/Mrs. Paromita which was excellent, just excellent. She thoroughly explained the entirety of the property and the reasons behind certain designs and other minute details.\n\nI also had a word with a manager and chef none of whose name I recall regarding the naan and they explained why it was the way it was.\n\nMr. Raj at reception shared a heartfelt goodbye along with his other colleagues whom I mentioned before and we clicked some memorable photos as well. It was really nice but I won't be attaching those to respect their privacy.\n\nEven apart from the humble gentlemen and gentlewomen I mentioned in my review there were many others who made our stay really really great.\n\nNow let's break down some of my likes and bit of my dislikes:\n\nLikes:\n1. A really secluded and nested away property which doesn't get many fly-by guests so it is peaceful.\n2. One of the best hotel services I've ever experienced, definitely in my top ten as of now.\n3. Well maintained and clean rooms.\n4. Flute in the morning is absolutely awesome.\n5. Good spread for breakfast.\n6. Attention to detail.\n\nDislikes:\n1. Extremely limited set menu option, and I mean extremely limited.\n2. One dessert for three people to share.\n3. Naan is not the typical Mughal Naan we are mostly accustomed to.\n4. Really small pool.\n5. The bathing area could have been entirely closed off with a glass door from the rest of the bathroom.\n6. The complimentary sides served with the cocktail wasn't good.\n\nOverall even though there are other hotels I would choose for rooms and other restaurants I would prefer to East India Room, I would select this hotel in a heartbeat simply for their attentive service!",

The service was top notch, the staff was really good.\n\nTalking about the food. It was finger licking good. I really enjoyed the food here and kept ordering as you can see in the photos.\n\nFirst day order was - veg pulao and dal tadka in lunch. The taste was really good.\nEvening time ordered masala tea and crispy chilli chicken. Loved it.\nThe tea was okay.\n\nSecond day order for lunch - chicken tandoori, mix veg and roti\nChicken tandoori was soft juicy tender perfectly cooked, taste was really nice.\nMix veg 10/10\n\nI must say they about the quantity of the food, one plate order is enough for two adults.\n\nThe only drawback was the safety, as the window gets open if you want to smoke you can do that there but they doesn't have any safety grill. Have to be careful if you are with children.\n\nIt's centrally located in main road but once you get inside the room it's quiet because of the sound proof windows.\n\nThe check in and check out was hassle free. Doesn't have to wait.\n\nI booked it through clear trip in an offer so we got the room for Rs 5609 including tax for 2 nights. And including food the total amount was upto Rs 9600 approx.\n\nIt was a wonderful stay. Highly recommended. If not for stay then at least can try their restaurant \"Page 54\" For amazing food.\n\nThank you for your lovely service.",

I don't get disturbed due to this but if u r kind of person who want complete silence then avoid this property on weekends. For people who are ok with little noise can go for it.

The corners are filthy, I would suggest HARPIC RED to get rid of those unpleasant looking stains. The toilet seats are worn out, lost it's polish because of using harsh chemicals like HARPIC, I assume. The bathroom fittings like the shower and taps need to be replaced. The owner can replace them using 1 nights money EASILY.\n\nThe staff is very well behaved, 5 star for that. But they might need 1 star training in order to deserve a 5 star rating. Welcome drink was a surprise though.\n\nThe rooms are spacious without compromise, safe was there, mini refrigerator, silent AC, the ceiling fan was wobbling and very noisy at low speed Room#405\n\nThe hotel's restaurant is very very nice and the chef is simply the best, we did meet him and thanked him enough.\n\nThe breakfast was sooo good. Everything from fresh in house watermelon and pineapple and papaya juices, different types of cornflakes, sweets, pastries, cakes and cupcakes, jams, butter, coffee, tea, palm dates, dry fruits, fresh cut fruits, parathas, poor and idlis and poha and what not. The last time I visited Kolkata, I had stayed at the LALIT GREAT EASTERN but this KEMPTON beat it easily believe me, just miniature if compared but a champion. I'll definitely stay here once again.\n\nThe location is fantastic, landmark location. The ONLY major issue was the noise from neighboring buildings, the constant loud roar of Air Conditioner outdoor units chewed up our brains no exaggeration believe me.\n\nPLEASE REPLACE THE BATHROOM FITTINGS and replace the floor tiles in the bathroom. before I come again :))))",

From the moment I walked through the grand entrance, I was captivated by the elegance and opulence of the hotel.\n\nThe staff at JW Marriott were incredibly warm and welcoming, ensuring that every aspect of my stay was impeccable. The check-in process was swift, and the concierge was always at hand to provide helpful recommendations and assist with any inquiries. Their attention to detail and commitment to customer service truly set them apart.\n\nThe rooms at JW Marriott were nothing short of stunning. Spacious, tastefully decorated, and exuding a sense of modern luxury, my accommodation provided a haven of comfort. The bed was incredibly plush, ensuring a restful night's sleep, and the amenities provided were of the highest quality.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the exceptional dining options available at the hotel. From a gourmet breakfast buffet that catered to every culinary desire to an exquisite fine dining restaurant that delighted my taste buds, the culinary experience was truly remarkable. The chefs showcased their expertise with delectable dishes that left a lasting impression.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were equally impressive. The fitness center was well-equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, and the spa offered a range of rejuvenating treatments that left me feeling pampered and relaxed. The pool area provided a tranquil oasis, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploring the city.\n\nLocation-wise, JW Marriott couldn't be better situated. It was conveniently located near popular attractions, shopping centers, and vibrant nightlife, making it an ideal base for exploring the city.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at JW Marriott was an unforgettable experience. The impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, delectable dining options, and excellent facilities combined to create a truly remarkable stay.

From the moment I entered the elegant premises, I was captivated by the grandeur and attention to detail.\n\nThe hotel's ambiance exuded a perfect blend of opulence and warmth. The staff greeted me with genuine smiles and impeccable hospitality, making me feel like a valued guest throughout my stay. The check-in process was swift and seamless, allowing me to settle in quickly and start enjoying the amenities.\n\nMy room at ITC Sonar Bangla was an oasis of comfort and sophistication. The tastefully decorated space boasted contemporary furnishings, plush bedding, and state-of-the-art amenities. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect, from the carefully selected artwork to the luxurious bathroom adorned with premium toiletries.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the dining experience at the hotel's various restaurants. Each venue showcased a diverse range of cuisines, and I found myself indulging in delectable dishes from around the world. The quality of the food was outstanding, and the culinary team's expertise was evident in every bite. The attentive service further enhanced the dining experience, ensuring that every meal was a memorable one.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were equally impressive. I took advantage of the fitness center, which was well-equipped with modern machines and offered a refreshing environment for my workout sessions. Additionally, the spa provided a serene sanctuary where I could unwind and rejuvenate with a pampering massage, leaving me feeling relaxed and revitalized.\n\nITC Sonar Bangla's commitment to sustainability also deserves commendation. The property showcased several eco-friendly initiatives, such as rainwater harvesting and energy-efficient practices, which resonated with my own values and made my stay even more enjoyable.\n\nThe location of the hotel was another plus point. Situated amidst lush greenery, it provided a peaceful retreat away from the bustling city. However, it was still conveniently located near major attractions, making it easy to explore the vibrant culture and heritage of Kolkata.\n\nOverall, my two-night stay at ITC Sonar Bangla was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel's exquisite ambiance, impeccable service, luxurious amenities, and delectable dining options created an unforgettable experience. I would highly recommend this haven of indulgence to anyone seeking a remarkable stay in Kolkata. I certainly look forward to returning in the future.",

It's a heritage property that boasts of its beautiful guests who have been through the halls since 1973. It is a truly special experience staying at this property, especially if you choose the room with the smoking area. Else you can smoke all over the property wherever you spot an ashtray. The staff are very friendly accommodating and helpful, the food is rich and tasty, especially when local delicacies are made. The feeling of staying here and seeing my friends married was one thing, the property is so elegantly beautiful that you will be mesmerised throughout your stay with something new to learn every minute. Feels like staying at a place that is home. It's located near the market and ATMs are plenty around, you can also find a lot of great places to eat and shop in the vicinity.",

The unique touch of all the waiters dressed like sailors and the manager in a captain's attire, along with ship-themed decor, creates an immersive ambiance.\n\nConnected to the main hotel by a mini-bridge over a trench surrounded by water, the hotel offers stunning views from every angle, even from the comfort of your room. If you prefer a balcony, they can accommodate that too, allowing you to soak in the picturesque surroundings.\n\nWith both food and liquor served, guests can enjoy a complete dining experience. Plus, the hotel's proximity to iconic landmarks like Victoria Memorial and cathedrals makes it an ideal base for exploring the city.\n\nThe hotel's own lawn space for parking, complete with a railway line crossing nearby, adds to the unique charm of the place.

The housekeeping team led by Anirban was fantastic and even took extra care to provide air purifiers and adjusted the throbbing bass from the club downstairs so that we could rest very comfortably with solid soundproofing.

It was truly heartwarming to witness the dedication and care exhibited by the entire team throughout our time at the hotel.\n\nOne aspect that particularly amazed us was the attention to detail in maintaining cleanliness. We were astonished to find that the bed linen was changed every day, and our rooms were thoroughly cleaned. This level of diligence and commitment to providing a pristine environment truly exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe dining experience at Kenilworth Hotel Kolkata was nothing short of superb. We were delighted to discover that the hotel staff was more than willing to go beyond their listed menu to cater to our preferences. It was evident that they took pride in ensuring that each guest had an unforgettable dining experience. The smiling faces and genuine care from the staff made us feel like valued guests throughout our meals. Their level of care and hospitality truly elevated the hotel's status to more than a five-star establishment in our eyes.\n\nDuring our check-out process, we experienced one of the fastest and smoothest procedures we have encountered. The efficiency with which the staff handled both our check-in and check-out was impressive. It left us with a sense of ease and convenience, further enhancing our overall experience.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of our stay was the range of pillow options available to us. The hotel's attention to providing personalized comfort was evident in this regard. The combination of a comfortable bed, plush pillows, and a peaceful ambiance made for a truly restful sleep.\n\nOur stay at Kenilworth\nHotel Kolkata ranks among the best we have ever experienced, and we wholeheartedly recommend it to others seeking an exceptional stay in the city. The warm and welcoming environment, coupled with the staff's impeccable care and hospitality, made us feel at home away from home.\n\nAlmost every member of the staff took the time to ask if we would consider visiting again, and we can say with certainty that we will.
