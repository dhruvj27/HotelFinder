Even though they send multiple emails asking if you need anything prior to check-in, it appears they don\u2019t actually look at your response. Neeraj in the Summit Lounge made-up for the concierge\u2019s mistakes, though. Normally traveling with children in high-end resorts can make you feel isolated, but he made us feel so welcome by bringing course after course of warm food for the kids and refreshing (amazing) drinks for the adults. He was the star of the show! The pool was a favorite for our whole group, although it is shut down in the rain. The food options pleased all. The limited seating in the pavilion was not ideal, and the wait staff there could use more training. The showstopper was the rooms - I was amazed by the intricate details in design and the comforting amenities that make you feel at home.

The experience was fantastic, and my heart was always racing with excitement whether I was in my room or exploring the hotel. The food was beautiful, and breakfast was excellent. The service was top-class, and the swimming pool was gorgeous. The only small issue was that on the weekend, someone from outside was using the pool, which I wasn't too happy about, but apart from that, everything was amazing. I had one of the best times and can't wait to return again and again. I'm a true fan now, and I'll see you in October 2025!\"",

That thoughtfulness set the tone for our stay.\n\nSpecial mention to the young lady and gentleman in the Grappa Bar, who were especially welcoming and the cleaner at the entrance who always smiled and said hi and would dry the seating near the smoking area so we could sit.\n\nThe hotel itself is very well maintained and extremely clean, even if some areas of the rooms felt a little dated in their decor. The gym and sauna were a highlight \u2013 spotless, peaceful, hi-tech, modern and again with excellent staff support.\n\nIf I could suggest one improvement, it would be the in-room coffee. As someone who needs a proper coffee before starting the day, I would have loved to see a coffee machine or at least higher-quality coffee bags rather than instant sachets. For a luxury property, this small detail would really make a difference.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience.

From the moment I arrived, the service was impeccable\u2014every detail was taken care of with such attention. The staff was welcoming and professional, always ensuring that I was comfortable and had everything I needed.\n\nThe room was spacious, beautifully designed, and had all the modern amenities I could ask for, with a touch of luxury that made it feel extra special. The view was stunning, and the bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night after a busy day.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the swimming pool. It was the perfect place to unwind and relax. The pool was pristine, surrounded by lush greenery, offering a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle. The setting was just beautiful, and I enjoyed spending time there, whether I was swimming laps or simply lounging by the water.\n\nDining at The Leela was also a treat. The variety of food options was fantastic, and the quality was top-notch. Every meal felt like a delightful experience, and the ambiance of the restaurants was perfect for both casual and fine dining.\n\nOverall, my stay was a smooth and relaxing experience, and I left feeling completely rejuvenated.

The hotel is not only centrally located but also offers easy access to most attractions and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is delightful.

The hotel itself is beautiful, with a great location. It\u2019s clean, the rooms are lovely, and from a physical and design standpoint, it meets the standard of what you\u2019d expect from a luxury property.\n\nBut sadly, my experience was affected by the service, particularly from the restaurant staff. I want to be fair hotel staff around the world are usually warm, professional, and kind. But during my stay, I couldn\u2019t ignore how I was treated, especially compared to other guests. Being a person of color, I felt I was treated differently, and that feeling was hard to shake. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cultural issue or something else, but it was clear that white guests were given noticeably better service.\n\nOne example: I was seated at breakfast at a table that still had dirty glasses and utensils from a previous guest. No one came to clean it or offer fresh cutlery. Meanwhile, a white guest seated right before me was shown to a fully set, clean table without delay. That kind of disparity is hard to overlook, especially in a hotel that calls itself five-star.\n\nExperiencing this type of treatment made me feel uncomfortable and, frankly, discriminated against. It\u2019s disappointing, because this hotel has so much potential but service like that falls far below the standard that should come with the rating and price tag.\n\nIf The Lalit wants to be a truly world-class hotel, it needs to ensure all guests are treated with equal respect and dignity regardless of skin color or nationality.\n\nIt prides itself in being LGBT Friendly, I am part of that community, Not because you employ LGBT individuals means you are respectful and professional. Its a shame BUT I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN OR never RECOMMEND ANYONE too",

Certainly not good value.\n\nMy room was a good size, spacious and quiet.

The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with comfortable beds and plenty of natural light. I also appreciated the thoughtful touches like fresh flowers and fruit baskets that were provided.\n\nThe staff at The Lodhi were exceptional in every way. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted warmly and made to feel right at home. Everyone I encountered during my stay was friendly, professional, and eager to make sure that I had everything I needed to enjoy my time in New Delhi.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the food. The hotel has several excellent restaurants, each serving delicious cuisine that showcases the best of Indian and international flavors. I particularly enjoyed the rooftop restaurant, which offered stunning views of the city along with fantastic food and cocktails.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend The Lodhi enough. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, this hotel is an excellent choice for anyone visiting New Delhi. The combination of luxurious accommodations, exceptional service, and delicious food makes it a true standout among the city's many hotels.",

This hotel truly deserves every one of its five stars and more. Allow me to share my delightful experience.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the grand lobby, I was greeted by the friendly and attentive staff who made me feel like a VIP. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and I was immediately impressed by the luxurious and elegant ambiance of the hotel.\n\nThe rooms at ITC Maurya are simply stunning. Spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with modern amenities, they provided a comfortable and relaxing sanctuary after a long day of exploring the city. The attention to detail in the room design was impeccable, and the plush bedding ensured a restful night's sleep.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the incredible dining options available at the hotel. The restaurants showcased a diverse range of cuisines, each offering an exceptional culinary experience. Whether it was the authentic Indian delicacies at Bukhara or the delectable international fare at Pavilion, every meal was a gastronomic delight. The attentive service and impeccable presentation added an extra touch of elegance to my dining experience.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were equally impressive. The fitness center was well-equipped, allowing me to maintain my workout routine even while traveling. The spa was a haven of tranquility, offering a wide range of rejuvenating treatments. The outdoor pool area provided a refreshing oasis in the heart of the bustling city, and the meticulously maintained gardens added a touch of serenity to the surroundings.\n\nWhat truly sets ITC Maurya apart is its exceptional service. The staff members consistently went above and beyond to ensure my stay was memorable. From the doormen to the housekeeping staff, everyone was friendly, professional, and dedicated to making my experience unforgettable. I was truly impressed by the level of personalized attention I received throughout my stay.\n\nThe hotel's location is another advantage. Situated in the diplomatic enclave of Delhi, it offers convenient access to major attractions, shopping areas, and business districts. Whether I wanted to explore historical landmarks or indulge in retail therapy, everything was within easy reach.\n\nIn conclusion, ITC Maurya Hotel Delhi surpassed my expectations in every way. The impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, outstanding dining options, and convenient location all contributed to an unforgettable five-star experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a truly exceptional stay in Delhi. I can't wait to return for another memorable visit!",

The hotel's commitment to cleanliness and hygiene was also noticeable, providing an extra layer of assurance during these uncertain times.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of the JW Marriott Hotel Aerocity was its culinary delights. With a plethora of dining options, from fine-dining restaurants to casual cafes, each meal was a gastronomic adventure. The diverse cuisines on offer catered to various palates, and the quality of ingredients and presentation were exemplary.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were equally impressive. The state-of-the-art fitness center, complete with modern equipment and experienced trainers, allowed me to maintain my exercise routine effortlessly.

            "text": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Radisson Blu Hotel, New Delhi Dwarka, and I must say that it was an experience that exceeded my expectations in many ways. This hotel is a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and convenience, and I am thrilled to share my detailed review.\n\nLocation and Accessibility\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of staying at Radisson Blu is its location in Dwarka, one of the most well-connected areas of New Delhi. The hotel is just a short drive away from the Indira Gandhi International Airport, making it an ideal choice for both business and leisure travelers. Additionally, it is well-connected to other parts of the city via the Dwarka Metro Station, making it easy to explore the capital. Whether you\u2019re here for a business meeting or a family vacation, the location is incredibly convenient.\n\nFirst Impressions and Ambiance\n\nAs soon as I walked into the Radisson Blu, I was immediately struck by the grand entrance and the modern yet elegant d\u00e9cor. The lobby exudes luxury, with high ceilings, contemporary furniture, and tasteful artwork. The staff at the reception desk were incredibly welcoming and efficient, making check-in a breeze. The overall ambiance of the hotel is calm and soothing, offering a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of New Delhi.\n\nRoom Quality and Comfort\n\nI stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms, and I was very impressed with the space and comfort it offered. The room was spacious, immaculately clean, and well-equipped with all the amenities you could ask for. The king-sized bed was incredibly comfortable, and I had no trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep. The room had a modern design, with sleek furniture, a large flat-screen TV, and a minibar stocked with a selection of beverages and snacks. The bathroom was equally impressive, with a rain shower, luxurious toiletries, and soft, fluffy towels. The attention to detail in the room\u2019s design and cleanliness was top-notch, making it feel like a home away from home.\n\nService Excellence\n\nWhat truly set Radisson Blu apart was the exceptional service. The staff were consistently polite, professional, and eager to assist with anything I needed. From the concierge team helping me with local recommendations to the room service staff bringing up food promptly and with a smile, every interaction I had with the hotel staff was positive. Special mention to Rahul Yadav and Neeraj Pandey, who went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable. The service here truly elevates the overall experience, making it feel personalized and exclusive.\n\nDining Experience\n\nThe hotel offers a variety of dining options, and I had the pleasure of experiencing both. The buffet breakfast at the all-day dining restaurant was fantastic, with a wide range of dishes catering to both continental and Indian tastes. There was something for everyone \u2013 from freshly baked croissants and cereals to dosas, parathas, and traditional Indian curries. The quality and taste of the food were outstanding, and the staff were attentive, ensuring that everything was well-stocked.\n\nI also dined at the hotel\u2019s specialty restaurants, where I had a chance to try some Indian delicacies. The food was rich in flavor, with generous portions. The chefs here do a fantastic job of preparing food that reflects the true essence of Indian cuisine. The service was prompt, and the wait staff were always attentive without being intrusive.\n\nFacilities and Amenities\n\nThe hotel offers a wide range of facilities that make it suitable for both business and leisure guests. The gym is well-equipped, and the spa provides a relaxing escape after a long day of sightseeing or work. There is also a large outdoor pool, perfect for unwinding in the evening. The business center is well-appointed, and the hotel offers meeting rooms and event spaces for corporate gatherings, making it a great option for business travelers.",
