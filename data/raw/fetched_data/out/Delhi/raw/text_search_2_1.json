His attention to detail, prompt assistance, and friendly approach made the check-in process seamless and left a lasting impression on our family. He truly represents the high standard of hospitality Tivoli is known for.\n\nThe rooms were exceptionally clean, well-maintained, and spacious, offering all modern amenities and a relaxing ambiance that made us feel right at home. The housekeeping staff ensured everything was in perfect order throughout our stay.\n\nThe service across all departments was commendable. Every staff member we interacted with was polite, helpful, and genuinely committed to guest satisfaction. Room service was timely and efficient, and any requests were addressed promptly with a smile.\n\nOne of the highlights of our stay was the food \u2013 absolutely delicious and well-prepared. Whether it was breakfast or dinner, the spread was impressive, with a good variety to suit all tastes. The chefs and F&B team deserve full credit for their effort and consistency in maintaining high culinary standards.\n\nOverall, Hotel Tivoli in Chattarpur is a true gem for families seeking comfort, elegance, and exceptional hospitality. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Delhi, whether for leisure or business. We look forward to returning soon for another memorable experience.",

Two other malls along with many food options are at 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel.\n\nThe staff gets 10 stars out of 5. Very friendly. Everyone working at this hotel goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable.\n\nRooms are spacious and clean. When there are conferences/events by local companies, and their employees stay here, they end up smoking in non-smoking rooms. I have heard fire alarms going off in the middle of the night.\n\nThe breakfast buffet is good, with verities of options. But it's the same exact food (with small variations in the name) every day, so if you are staying here for more than 3-4 days, you will get bored.\n\nThe only complaint I have with this hotel is the spa. They have a whole menu of various type of exotic massages such as Indian massage, Thai massage etc, but the only services available were Swedish and deep tissue massage. My massage therapist spent so much time on my legs, that she ran out of time. She literally only had time to do two vertical strokes (no massaging) on my back and arms so that it can be called a full body massage. A complete waste of money.\n\nI would still strongly recommend this hotel for a great stay mainly because of the staff and the location, but I wouldn't recommend the spa at all.",

Google Maps is generally accurate enough if you are driving to the property as we did.\n\nUpon arrival, you realise that there\u2019s NO dedicated parking per se but parking is provided for hotel guests within the Mall\u2019s parking - you don\u2019t need to pay anything extra. However, it\u2019s advisable that you avail of the valet service as they will ensure that your vehicle is safely parked and that your FASTag is not scanned for parking payment.\n\nThat said, now let\u2019s move to the actual property itself. The check-in was a tedious affair as the personnel manning the desk(s) were very curt and inconsiderate. Not even a smile. Fortunately, as a Premium member of the Radisson Rewards scheme, we were upgraded to a suite - Room # 414, which is spacious and well lit by natural light. The air conditioning is excellent and the amenities good. Unfortunately, the bathroom was not clean - the actual commode was dirty with water stains and so were the sanitary fittings - all of them. Worse, water would very quickly fill up in the shower cubicle; an obvious result of a partly clogged drain.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and mattress adequately firm without sagging under the weight. Pillows were also comfortable. Room service was prompt.\n\nAs far as my wife and I are concerned, the hotel\u2019s biggest selling point is that it\u2019s slap bang within the Mall and you can walk from the reception directly into the Select Citywalk mall.\n\nUnfortunately, the included buffet breakfast left a lot to be desired. There was limited option especially in the cold meat section and worse, the refilling of dishes took inordinately long.\n\nThe valet service was efficient and our vehicle was promptly brought to the entrance even though we came in and out at odd hours.\n\nAll in all, a good property. I can only hope that they have that bathroom issue sorted out.\n\nThank you, Svelte for our comfortable stay even though it was for one night.",

The hotel's amenities and services were top-notch, and the staff was friendly and accommodating.\n\nThe swimming pool was great, with a slope depth that made it suitable for swimmers of all levels. I loved the classic and vintage vibes at the hotel, which added to the overall ambiance and made my stay even more memorable. The hotel rooms themselves had a beautiful vintage look, which perfectly complemented the overall aesthetic of the hotel.\n\nHowever, one thing that caught me off guard was the prices of items kept in the room. A small packet of peanuts (about 100mg) that normally costs around \u20b930 was charged at \u20b9300! That's a hefty markup, to say the least.\n\nApart from this, everything else about the hotel was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient. If you're planning to stay at Eros Hotel, just be aware of the prices of in-room items and plan accordingly. With a little awareness, you can have a wonderful stay at this hotel.",

From check-in to departure, the hospitality and professionalism of the staff stood out. The hotel is ideally located for business travelers, with easy access to Noida, Nehru Place, and Jasola, yet it still offers a peaceful and comfortable retreat from the city\u2019s hustle.\n\nThe room was spacious, well-maintained, and beautifully designed with all modern amenities. I especially appreciated the thoughtful touches like a separate shower and toilet area, which added to the comfort. The housekeeping was prompt and attentive throughout the stay.\n\nDining was another highlight \u2014 breakfast was exceptional, with a wide variety of Indian and international options. The South Indian dishes and fresh juices were particular favorites. I also enjoyed dinner at Edesia, which offered both great food and ambiance.\n\nFacilities like the rooftop pool and gym were well-kept and provided a relaxing escape after long meetings. I also loved the cake shop for quick snacks and sweet treats.\n\nOverall, Crowne Plaza Okhla delivers the perfect blend of comfort, service, and convenience. Highly recommended for both business and leisure travelers!",

One lift goes to stay-in guest rooms, another one goes to the eatery area on the 2nd floor, and yet another one takes you to the bridal room or banquet.

Not a single item fell short, my wife especially loved every bit of it.\n\nTo everyone at Pullman New Delhi Aerocity  thank you from the bottom of our hearts for making our stay not just comfortable, but truly unforgettable.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\nMr & Mrs Khan",

I always prefer hotel bars over clubs for this reason.\n\nThe seating was comfortable and well lit, making it the perfect place to catch up with friends. There is ample parking and the food is great too. You can visit here regardless of whether you are staying at the hotel or not.\n\nWould definitely recommend!",

The breakfast spread was disappointingly limited, lacking variety and failing to impress. Additionally, the room I stayed in was plagued by flies, especially at night.

With six to seven well-maintained rooms, the ambiance is both old world elegant and comfortable.\n\nThe lush greenery and calming environment make it an ideal spot, especially during the rainy season, which adds to the cozy vibe. The swimming pool is large and perfect for family time. The staff is extremely attentive, and I\u2019d love to mention Lakshmi who helped wheelchair my mom, he was particularly helpful during our stay.\n\nIncluded Breakfast is homely and comforting, with classics like parathas and poached eggs.

            "text": "We had a delightful stay at Lutyens Bungalow on Prithviraj Road in Delhi. The property beautifully preserves its historic charm while seamlessly incorporating modern amenities. With six to seven well-maintained rooms, the ambiance is both old world elegant and comfortable.\n\nThe lush greenery and calming environment make it an ideal spot, especially during the rainy season, which adds to the cozy vibe. The swimming pool is large and perfect for family time. The staff is extremely attentive, and I\u2019d love to mention Lakshmi who helped wheelchair my mom, he was particularly helpful during our stay.\n\nIncluded Breakfast is homely and comforting, with classics like parathas and poached eggs.
