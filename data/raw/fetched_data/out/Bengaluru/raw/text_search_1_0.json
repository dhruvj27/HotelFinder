A staff member (appeared to be a manager) rudely yelled at us once he realized we were from the event, saying we weren't allowed in that area.\n\nNo place to work: I had an urgent office call and couldn\u2019t find a place to sit in the event area. When I moved to the garden, security asked me to leave. At the reception area, I was forced to sit on the floor. Staff kept rudely shooing us away without suggesting a proper spot to work from.\n\nInadequate facilities: Only one washroom was available for a large crowd. It became dirty quickly, with no prompt cleaning. Paint was peeling in several areas, which was surprising for a hotel of this stature.\n\nFor a premium hotel hosting corporate guests, the lack of courtesy, basic amenities, and professionalism was very disappointing.",

A staff member (appeared to be a manager) rudely yelled at us once he realized we were from the event, saying we weren't allowed in that area.\n\nNo place to work: I had an urgent office call and couldn\u2019t find a place to sit in the event area. When I moved to the garden, security asked me to leave. At the reception area, I was forced to sit on the floor. Staff kept rudely shooing us away without suggesting a proper spot to work from.\n\nInadequate facilities: Only one washroom was available for a large crowd. It became dirty quickly, with no prompt cleaning. Paint was peeling in several areas, which was surprising for a hotel of this stature.\n\nFor a premium hotel hosting corporate guests, the lack of courtesy, basic amenities, and professionalism was very disappointing.",

The hotel amenities were great and added a lot to our stay, especially with a kid \u2014 everything felt safe, comfortable, and well-managed.\n\nDining was excellent \u2014 good variety, tasty food, and smooth service. The location is convenient, and the overall vibe of the hotel is relaxed yet elegant.

When I entered no help for over 10 minutes to help me park my car. Then one staff came. I was trying to park my New Car which I had taken delivery on Fri only. The passage to go to basement for parking was so narrow with steep incline that my car hit the wall in the left and got dented. The behaviour of the reception in the night was very rude with no courtesy.\nRoom : no water to drink, intercom did not work had to go down from 3rd floor just to find no one in the reception.\nThe Cot in the room has sharp edges which hurt my leg. Pillow not clean, may be used one.\nNever will I stay in the hotel nor will I recommend anyone.",

They displayed a courteous approach.\nHousekeeping was great; they maintained the room well and in order. (With the given limitation and property age)\nTea and coffee are well-made at breakfast, and the chef at the live kitchen making dosa is very courteous and empathetic.\n\nSome Unpleasant ones: (Undesirable and unexpected from the hospitality standpoint)\n\nThe Executive chef was extremely rude and loud. Not only did he misbehave in front of the guest and the staff in the restaurant, but he was also aggressive and almost charged at me. What if he had hit me! He was unapologetic and unempathetic. The staff present there agreed to his misdemeanour and were surprised.\nIt\u2019s a safety issue; a mentally unstable person is dangerous.\nThe bone of contention was that I demanded no or extremely low salt food \u2013 I am on a dietary restriction and couldn\u2019t have gobhi paratha on 9th July last day of my stay. (There was no proper alternative in the buffet on the same day) I requested Aloo Paratha, believing that it would be low on salt, as in the past 02 days it was, and normally in a 4/5 star hotel, one does not have to worry about the excess salt. However, Paratha came with more salt, which I brought to the restaurant manager's attention, who directed me to the executive chef.\nHe offered a chance to serve something else. We agreed upon Poha. I believed that the chef knows my salt threshold and will make the poha suitably. However, Poha came late and with high salt. Upon complaining about this to the chef, he got extremely hyper and was loud to convince me that I had a problem, and the salt was a generous amount. Well, this makes no sense when one is aware of the expectation of the guest.\nThe upma served the previous day on the cheffing dish was hard and was not well kept. I informed the chef about the same, too.\nThe restaurant is an open space with greenery around, bound to have fruit flies. The Cut Fruits and Sprouts were kept open on the counter, attracting flies. When you have a croissant in a closed lid, why were Fruits, Sprouts and Muffins kept open?\nOn arrival, the room was not blocked as per the shared expectation. The room booked was a corner room with a window facing the road, and it was a lot noisier. They shifted to another room, which also had a lot of noise, and were shifted to the third room, which was a smoking room(I had asked for a non-smoking room), but it was quiet and had no sipage smell, so I was fine to use it for that night.

The hotel itself has plenty of welcoming staff. The best verity breakfast I\u2019ve had in India and the plants all around really make it unique. Close to the park and definitely quite and enjoyable stay. As I come from a different country, having built in power switches that fit all most international outlets is very comfortable",

The sensor actuated lights give you privacy and it feels like you are in your private bedroom at night. Workstations have a very cool view and are better than my office. Privacy is maintained strictly. Only problem is when you get the last bunkers (30 & 31) they won't suck enough AC from outside. The bunker size is as good as the sleeper coach buses.lights inside bunkers can be adjusted as per our wish.   I was skeptic about the maintenance of the space before booking. But after reaching there at night I felt I reached a place to sleep, the place is so quite and lights are all dimmed matching to the time. As the lights are on sensors there is not much bright lights while entering to your bunk. registration process is also easy. Though the space is 90% full it is as quite as your bedroom. Bathrooms are also decently maintained. The best part I liked is the Workspace they provided along with beautiful interiors and fantastic software tech park view are better than my office. If you are looking for budget friendly and looking to crash for a night. this is go to place for budget friendly travellers.",

The rooms, while compact, were clean, well-maintained, and offered a beautiful view of Haridwar - ideal for a business/solo stay. The shower area was surprisingly spacious, though I wasn\u2019t a fan of the toilet and washbasin being combined. Still, it served the purpose well!!\n\nA special shoutout to the Duty Manager from the Front Office who spoke to me before check-in; he was extremely kind and thoughtful. Since I had booked the stay as a surprise weekend getaway for my sister after a long work week, he arranged for a lovely handwritten note and a small pastry cake in the room. That personal touch truly made our arrival feel special!!!!\n\nThe gym and pool were great although we wish we had the time to use them!! At the restaurant, the service team was extremely hospitable - staff like Nandini and one more girl whose name I forgot were warm and friendly, and it made breakfast enjoyable. But, this was slightly marred when Subhash interrupted our chat and called them away abruptly, citing \u201cwork,\u201d which felt unnecessary and unprofessional - brief interactions with guests should be welcomed, not shut down!!\n\nThe breakfast had an impressive spread of South Indian dishes, which were delicious. However, the bread section was a letdown - items like the toast, croissants, danish pastries, donuts, pancakes, waffles, and French toast lacked freshness and texture. I do hope they improve this area as they host more than just Indian guests. The chef was kind enough to check in and offer alternatives, which we appreciated!!!\n\nOne area that truly fell short was the handling of my late checkout request. The Front Office Manager Mr. Mallik said he would check and get back to us reg our request while he was checking us in the late evening, but never followed up. When I ran into him the next morning at the lobby, he didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all or provide an answer - something as simple as a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d would have sufficed. That lack of basic courtesy was disappointing!!!\n\nDespite these hiccups, the overall vibe of the hotel was good. With a few improvements in professionalism and breakfast variety, it could easily move from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat.\u201d It\u2019s a nice spot for solo travelers - whether for a short trip or an extended work stay!!!!",

We spent over two hours with continuous disturbance from the technician, only to eventually resolve the issue on our own. The Samsung Android TV provided in the room seems to be just for show.\n2.\tSubstandard Amenities \u2013 The bathroom amenities were shocking for a Taj property. They provided cheap \u20b95 soaps instead of a proper handwash bottle. Even after multiple requests, they didn\u2019t provide handwash and instead sent more small soaps.\n3.\tUnresponsive Reception \u2013 Nobody answers calls at the reception, making even basic communication a hassle.\n4.\tDelayed Room Service \u2013 Any food order takes over 45 minutes to arrive, which is highly inconvenient.\n5.\tOverall Service Experience \u2013 The service quality is far below Taj standards. From the very first day, the experience was pathetic, stressful, and disappointing. Despite paying for 8 days upfront, the first day itself left us dissatisfied and regretful of our choice.\n\nWe had high expectations from Taj, but our experience at Vivanta, Residency Road, has been extremely disappointing.

The hotel's location was perfect, overlooking the Race Course and surrounded by lots of trees.\n\nThe rooms and service were top-notch, just like you'd expect from this hotel chain.

They made sure I got the room I wanted, which was a nice touch.\n\nI want to give a shout-out to a few people who made my stay even better. The buffet breakfast at Cafe G was delicious, and the staff there were so dedicated. The chef even remembered how I liked my mini-pancakes, which was a nice surprise.\n\nThe front door staff were really helpful too. They took care of my luggage and had it ready for me when I needed it. Braison at the front desk was super helpful with my reservations and remembered all my room preferences.\n\nEven though no one escorted me to my room, it was okay because it was a busy day. But Aman from Cafe G and Sahid from Housekeeping went out of their way to make me feel welcome. They were both friendly and helpful.\n\nI also want to mention Prasanjit and Nitish from the In-Room Dining Staff. They were both really nice and made sure I had everything I needed during my stay. And the Alfredo Pasta from The In-Room Dining Oriental Box was amazing, it was a special request and I had it every day! And it was one of the reasons I chose this hotel again for my R&R stay.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holiday Inn, Racecourse was great.

The beds were cozy, and the linens were crisp and clean. I particularly appreciated the attention to detail in the room decor and the modern facilities.\n\nThe food at the hotel was outstanding! The menu offered a great variety of options, and the quality of the dishes was consistently high. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a wide range of options to suit all tastes.\n\nBut what truly made my stay special was the exceptional hospitality. Akanksha Kumari, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Holiday Inn Bengaluru Racecourse Road to anyone looking for a comfortable and memorable stay in Bangalore.

            "text": "Unwelcome Treatment: Discrimination at Ritz Carlton Bangalore\n\nYesterday, I, along with my team of 12, visited Ritz Carlton with high expectations for a delightful dining experience. As a passionate food blogger and traveller, I was eager to capture the essence of The Market restaurant through my lens and share it with my audience. However, what unfolded was nothing short of a disgraceful display of discrimination that left us utterly upset.\nBefore even setting foot in The Market, we were rudely confronted by an Operations Manager named Jocelyn Vaz. With an air of superiority, he demanded that I switch off my camera and forbade any form of video recording. To add insult to injury, he then instructed his subordinate to monitor our every move, as if we were criminals plotting some wicked act. This humiliating experience was witnessed by my entire team, leaving me insulted in from of my team ad us feeling sidelined and disrespected.\nDespite my attempt to address this issue personally with Jocelyn, the damage had already been done. It was only through the intervention of the Restaurant in charge, Mr. Sunil Kumar, that we received an acknowledgment for Jocelyn's inappropriate behaviour. While his apology was appreciated, it hardly compensated for the marked experience we suffered.\nThe incident at Ritz Carlton made us feel like unwelcome outsiders, unworthy of the same treatment as other guests. No number of regretful words can undo the sense of humiliation and disappointment that overshadowed what should have been a memorable dining experience. We had hoped for a good evening and hospitality, but instead, we were met with discrimination and disregard.\n\nMoving forward, it is with great reluctance that we vow not to visit Ritz Carlton again. Our hard-earned money and loyalty deserve to be appreciated, not met with prejudice and hostility. It's disheartening to see such behaviour tolerated in a renowned establishment like Ritz Carlton.\n\nI've had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience hospitality from some of the world's finest establishments, including Taj, Leela, The Oberoi, ITC, Four Seasons, and many others. Never have I encountered such disrespectful treatment. Even at 3-star and 4-star hotels where I've been personally invited, I've been greeted warmly, served by chefs, and offered premium accommodations with breathtaking views for me and my family. Unfortunately, the damage has been done, and this negative experience at Ritz Carlton stands out starkly against the backdrop of exceptional hospitality I've enjoyed elsewhere.\n\nI must take a moment to express my gratitude to Miss Rajshree Buragohain for her efforts in arranging our space and providing exceptional service. Thank you, Rajshree.",

Traveling with a 1-and-a-half-year-old baby can be challenging, but the exceptional service and attentiveness of the hotel staff made our experience truly delightful. This is the first trip abroad with our baby and I must especially mention the exceptional service of Tamanna who went out of her way to help us out during out stay. We really fell in love with this hotel mainly for ALL the staff here. They were all amazing from the check-in time (Very early in the morning around 4AM- they were all enthusiastic and so friendly)\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the staff went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. The hotel and restaurant staff even arranged baby-friendly meals, which was thoughtful. The room was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities we needed. They made sure the hotel kept it clean all the time and very friendly.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were top-notch. We enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet every morning, which had a wide variety of options to suit every palate. Buffet had a good selection of food and it was very tasty. The pool area was clean and well-maintained, providing a perfect spot to relax.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the staff's genuine care and willingness to assist us at every turn. Whether it was helping with our luggage, providing extra towels, or simply offering a warm smile, they made us feel at home.\n\nI highly recommend Radisson Blu Bengaluru Outer Ring Road for anyone looking for a comfortable and memorable stay, especially families with young children. We are grateful for the hospitality and look forward to returning in the future. I will go as far as to say, next time I come to Bengaluru, I will not think twice to book Radisson Blu Bengaluru Outer Ring Road.",

The hotel's prime location in the city center is a significant advantage, providing easy access to local attractions and business hubs. This is particularly beneficial for business travelers or tourists looking to explore Bengaluru.\n\nThe ambiance of the hotel is both elegant and comfortable, with tastefully decorated interiors that blend modernity and warmth. The rooms are spacious, offering a pleasant and relaxing environment. The cleanliness and maintenance of the hotel are noteworthy, reflecting their commitment to high standards.\n\nThe hotel staff deserves special mention for their professionalism and hospitality. They were attentive, courteous, and went out of their way to ensure a comfortable stay. The quality of service provided was exceptional, contributing significantly to the overall positive experience.\n\nThe dining options at the hotel were impressive, with a variety of cuisines that catered to different tastes. The food was delicious, well-prepared, and presented, making each meal a delightful experience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note a significant issue that occurred during my stay. On one of the nights, the air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly. This led to some discomfort, which was a setback in an otherwise flawless service experience. Although the staff responded to the issue, it is an area that requires attention to prevent future occurrences.\n\nIn conclusion, Royal Orchid Central Bengaluru is a commendable choice for anyone seeking quality accommodation in the city. Its strengths in location, ambiance, service, and dining are noteworthy. The issue with the air conditioning was a minor glitch in an otherwise excellent stay. I would recommend this hotel to others, keeping in mind the singular issue I faced.",

The staff were attentive, efficient, and went above and beyond to ensure my stay was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nThe room was tastefully decorated, with a perfect blend of modern amenities and comfortable furnishings. The bed was plush, the bathroom was spotless, and the views of the city were simply stunning.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's commitment to sustainability. From the eco-friendly toiletries to the energy-efficient lighting, it was clear that the Radisson Blu Centre City is dedicated to reducing its environmental footprint.\n\nThe hotel's location is also worth mentioning. Situated in the heart of the city, it's within walking distance to many popular attractions, restaurants, and shops.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at the Radisson Blu Centre City was truly unforgettable.

The shower head was suspended above a semi-sunken small bath, when modern showers are in a separate shower cubicle, some with rain-water heads.\nThere was no hot water.\nThere were lots of room fresheners hanging all over the bedrooms and corridors.

Reception staff seemed to be unable to find all our rooms, especially the day rooms, which just led to extra stress for the wedding party.

First and foremost, the staff at Capitol Hotel were incredibly welcoming and professional. From the moment I arrived at the test center, they made sure that all the necessary arrangements were in place and that the testing environment was conducive to focus and concentration. The registration process was smooth, and they were very helpful in answering any last-minute queries I had.\nThe testing rooms were spacious and well-lit, creating a comfortable atmosphere to take the exams. The chairs and desks were comfortable, ensuring that I didn't face any discomfort during the long duration of the tests. The hotel's quiet ambiance was perfect for the Listening section, and I could concentrate without any distractions. The technical setup for the Listening test was flawless, with high-quality audio equipment that ensured clarity in the recordings. Likewise, for the Writing test, they provided us with all the necessary materials, including answer sheets, stationary items and pens, leaving no room for stress or worries. Another aspect worth mentioning is the location of the hotel. It was conveniently located, making it easy for candidates like me to find the place without any trouble. Moreover, there were ample parking spaces available, which was a great relief for those who commuted by car. The test administrators were also very professional and strictly adhered to the official guidelines, ensuring a fair and transparent testing process for everyone. I appreciated their attention to detail and how they managed the test sessions efficiently.",
