            "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Fairfield by Marriott in Jaipur on the evening of 15th August, and I must say it turned out to be a truly memorable experience. The hotel had beautifully embraced the spirit of Independence Day, and the theme extended all the way to the buffet spread, a thoughtful and creative touch that instantly caught my attention.\nWe opted for the buffet dinner, and the variety on offer was impressive. There was a perfect balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, each prepared with care and packed with flavour. I especially appreciated how some of the dishes were inspired by the tricolour theme, not only did they look festive, but they also tasted wonderful. It was clear that the chefs had put a lot of heart into curating a menu that celebrated the occasion while delivering on quality and taste.\nThe ambiance of the restaurant added to the experience. The decor was elegant yet welcoming, and the Independence Day theme was tastefully incorporated without being over-the-top. What truly stood out, though, was the service. The staff was courteous, attentive, and genuinely warm, always checking in with a smile to make sure we had everything we needed. It\u2019s the kind of hospitality that makes you want to come back.\nOverall, it was a lovely evening filled with good food, a great atmosphere, and heartfelt service. If you\u2019re in Jaipur and looking for a place that combines great dining with thoughtful presentation and impeccable service, I\u2019d definitely recommend visiting Fairfield by Marriott. A big thumbs up for making this Independence Day dinner feel so special!",

I must mention the food of the hotel which was a highlight of my trip as I took all my meals in the hotel itself which was a delightful experience, the breakfast spread was good and had lots of vegetarian options. Overall, if you are looking to stay near the city and looking for top-notch amenities with a customer centric experience you can go with this hotel.\n\nI hope the hotel team and staff will maintain this experience and I look forward to my next visit soon.",

Right from the check-in till check-out the staff was courteous and helpful at each point. The cleanliness of rooms were exquisite and the housekeeping staff was really prompt. I must mention the food of the hotel which was a highlight of my trip as I took all my meals in the hotel itself which was a delightful experience, the breakfast spread was good and had lots of vegetarian options. Overall, if you are looking to stay near the city and looking for top-notch amenities with a customer centric experience you can go with this hotel.\n\nI hope the hotel team and staff will maintain this experience and I look forward to my next visit soon.",

The experience was marred by significant issues from start to finish.\nPros:\nThe breakfast and dinner buffet spreads were excellent.\nThe staff in the dining area were courteous and attentive.\nCons:\nPoor Check-in: Greeted by unsupervised trainees who were inept at handling guests.\nHealth Hazard: The swimming pool was infested with pigeons, a major hygiene concern.\nNeglected Facilities: The gym was unsupervised at 7:45 AM, and the club lounge coffee machine was unserviced at 10:30 PM.\nWorn-Out Property: Our club room felt tired, and the entire building had a dilapidated feel, far from the quality expected of the Marriott brand.\nThe dining staff were the only saving grace. Management needs to urgently address the lapses in service, hygiene, and maintenance",

If i could, i would give them negative stars.\n\nI made a reservation for a 3 day stay at their property and within a couple of hours of doing so came down with a serious flu and high grade fever.\n\nI requested them to make an exception to their 'no refund' policy on human and compassionate grounds by offering me a refund or at least a date change. But they just cold heartedly refused to budge and did not cooperate in anyway whatsoever.\n\nIts my past experience that even though prestigious properties frequently publish their fares as non refundable online, they generally treat that as a guideline only and happily override it in genuine, human circumstances. They recognise the importance of treating people with respect, care and humanity while still protecting their interests.\n\nBut not Vijayran Palace. No trace of compassion, empathy or consideration for others on human grounds. Just pure, unadulterated greed and mindless parroting of 'policy'.\n\nIn the world that they inhabit - policies, which are meant to be guidelines, have become excuses to not use one's own brain and agency.\n\nDisappointed. Id like to urge travellers to consider this - we all vote with our wallets. There are plenty of good properties but not many good people left in the world.\n\nIf we use our wallet to support properties that put care for people above blind and thoughtless pursuit of policy and pure greed, it would be one more way of making this world a better place.\n\nConsider this, before booking your stay here.

Food is average. In room dining orders took close to an hour. We had to cancel an order of kulcha as it took more than 40 mins to be sent and by then the food was cold!\nI truly have never seen a 5 star hotel with such bad service.\n\nThe duty manager at the time of check in, Angad, is someone who effortlessly can make a good day go bad and from there, to worse, for the guests. Zero sensitivity as to how to handle guests in a tough situation. No presence of mind!

Food is average. In room dining orders took close to an hour.

The rooms were spacious and clean with the all the amenities. The service was excellent with the small staff making you feel so welcome. The food was incredible as well. The hotel arranged  guide also provided excellent service and provided pick up and drop off services as well to the airport. The location is a bit farther outside of the main city of Jaipur so once you are there for the night it might be difficult to go back into the city.

It was obvious they either don\u2019t care about food hygiene or are cutting corners in the worst way possible.

They made me sit in a separate restaurant area, not the main one, which was basically a an oven where the AC barely worked (if at all). I have no idea why I was treated differently, but the main dining area was clearly better maintained\u2014and I was kept out of it for no reason.\n\nAbsolutely no sense of hospitality, cleanliness, or customer service.\nAvoid this place at all costs.

Their dedication ensured that every aspect of the event was handled flawlessly.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, the staff extended a warm welcome with impeccable hospitality that made me feel truly valued. Check-in was smooth and efficient, and I was escorted to a beautifully appointed room\u2014spacious, spotless, and tastefully decorated with modern amenities and subtle Rajasthani touches.\n\nThe dining options were equally impressive. Whether enjoying the lavish breakfast buffet or a fine dinner at one of their specialty restaurants, the food was consistently delicious and thoughtfully prepared. The service was attentive, courteous, and never intrusive.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the attention to detail\u2014from the seamless event coordination to the personalized hospitality touches throughout my stay. The hotel\u2019s location on Tonk Road is also ideal, offering easy access to both the airport and Jaipur\u2019s key attractions.\n\nInterContinental Jaipur is not just a venue\u2014it\u2019s an experience. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Pink City, whether for business or leisure. I look forward to returning soon!",

            "text": "I stayed at Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur for two nights during my visit to the Pink City. Here are my impressions of the hotel:\n\n## Location\n\nThe hotel is located in the city center, about 10 minutes' drive from Jaipur Airport and 15 minutes from Jaipur Junction railway station. It is also close to some of the main attractions of the city, such as Jal Mahal, City Palace, and Hawa Mahal. The hotel offers free parking, either underground or outdoors, and can arrange airport shuttles and day trips at the tour desk.\n\n## Rooms\n\nThe hotel has 108 non-smoking rooms, fitted with air conditioning, wooden flooring, a 40-inch LED TV, a minibar, a coffee/tea maker, a desk, a safe, slippers, a hair dryer, and bath products. The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable, with a sitting area and a city view. The hotel also has different types of suites and club rooms that offer additional amenities and services, such as fruit platters, complimentary minibar, snacks, discounts on F&B and spa, and access to the club lounge.\n\n## Facilities\n\nThe hotel has a rooftop outdoor pool that overlooks the Aravalli Hills, a gym, a spa, a business center, and ample event space. The pool is open from September to March and has a bar that serves Italian dishes and drinks. The gym is well-equipped and the spa offers various treatments and massages. The business center has computers, printers, and internet access. The event space can accommodate up to 500 guests for meetings, weddings, or parties.\n\n## Dining\n\nThe hotel has two restaurants and two bars. Sunflower is the main restaurant that serves a free buffet breakfast of Indian and continental dishes. It also offers lunch, dinner, and 24/7 room service. Liquid Ice is a cozy bar that serves continental and Indian cuisine, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. VUE is the rooftop bar that operates from September to March and offers Italian appetizers and entr\u00e9es. The club lounge is exclusive for club room guests and serves tea/coffee and snacks.\n\n## Service\n\nThe hotel staff are friendly, helpful, and professional. They provide 24-hour front desk service, concierge service, dry cleaning and laundry service, and daily housekeeping. They also assist with travel arrangements, luggage storage, currency exchange, car rental, and ticketing. They are attentive to the guests' needs and requests and make sure they have a pleasant stay.\n\n## Overall\n\nI enjoyed my stay at Ramada by Wyndham Jaipur. It is a modern, comfortable, and convenient hotel that offers good value for money. It has everything you need for a business or leisure trip to Jaipur. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the city's culture and history.",
