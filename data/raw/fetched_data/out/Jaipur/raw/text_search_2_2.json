            "text": "My recent stay at Sarovar Portico was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nCheck-in Delays & Zero Assistance\nI arrived around 2:00\u20132:30 PM, the standard check-in time, yet I was asked to wait \u201c5 minutes\u201d to check room availability \u2014 which turned into 20\u201325 minutes. I had 2\u20133 pieces of luggage and requested help from reception, but even after waiting 10\u201315 minutes, no one came. I ended up carrying everything myself.\n\nBasic Amenities Missing\nThere were no mineral water bottles in the room. I had to call three times, and each time it felt like they were stalling. After much follow-up, I finally got two small bottles. I also ordered food online, but they initially refused to allow delivery and later outright refused to send someone to collect it.\n\nTerrible Hygiene Standards\nThe room\u2019s mattresses were full of fungus \u2014 an extremely serious health hazard. I have photos to prove it. In the morning, someone had vomited inside the lift, and no staff bothered to clean it. This is the kind of \u201chospitality\u201d they offer.\n\nBreakfast Disaster\nBreakfast service deserves zero stars. Bowls were mostly unavailable, and staff were nowhere to be found to assist.\n\nPathetic Room Service\nCalling \u201cRoom Service\u201d always connects to reception, where you\u2019re told to dial another number for help \u2014 which no one ever answers. I have been waiting 45 minutes for an iron to press my clothes as I write this review.\n\nBottom Line\nFrom delayed check-in to unhygienic rooms, poor service, and unresponsive staff, Sarovar Portico failed in every basic aspect of hospitality. This is not what one expects from a reputed hotel brand.\n\nWould I recommend this place? Absolutely NOT\n\nThere are a lot more things to write but o thought of highlighting these basic issues.\n\nThanks,\nRanjan",

Coming from Shimla during the peak of summer, we were pleasantly surprised by how refreshing and vibrant the experience was.\n\nEach morning was a cultural treat \u2014 we explored majestic forts and historic landmarks, soaking in the rich heritage of the Pink City. But what truly made the trip extraordinary was our stay at the hotel.\n\nAfter returning from our adventures, a dip in the rooftop swimming pool was the perfect way to unwind. The water was cool, clean, and incredibly soothing. As evening descended, the hotel came alive with beautiful live music and singing. The singer was truly outstanding, and the quality of the music was excellent \u2014 soulful, heartfelt, and deeply moving. It created a magical atmosphere, one of those rare moments you know you'll remember forever.\n\nThe entire vibe of the hotel was positive and peaceful. The temperature was surprisingly comfortable, the environment relaxing, and the staff warm and welcoming. Every meal we had was a delight \u2014 delicious, well-prepared, and satisfying.\n\nMy wife, who is deeply passionate about music, was especially touched by the performances. We both felt completely recharged \u2014 as if we had stepped out of time and into a calm, joyful escape. It didn\u2019t feel like summer anymore; it felt like serenity.\n\nThank you for such an amazing experience. These are the memories we\u2019ll carry with us for a long, long time!\n\nImprovement: need to restrict for birds in swimming pool , it's can be infected the people who swim in the pool",

Coming from Shimla during the peak of summer, we were pleasantly surprised by how refreshing and vibrant the experience was.\n\nEach morning was a cultural treat \u2014 we explored majestic forts and historic landmarks, soaking in the rich heritage of the Pink City. But what truly made the trip extraordinary was our stay at the hotel.\n\nAfter returning from our adventures, a dip in the rooftop swimming pool was the perfect way to unwind. The water was cool, clean, and incredibly soothing. As evening descended, the hotel came alive with beautiful live music and singing. The singer was truly outstanding, and the quality of the music was excellent \u2014 soulful, heartfelt, and deeply moving. It created a magical atmosphere, one of those rare moments you know you'll remember forever.\n\nThe entire vibe of the hotel was positive and peaceful. The temperature was surprisingly comfortable, the environment relaxing, and the staff warm and welcoming. Every meal we had was a delight \u2014 delicious, well-prepared, and satisfying.\n\nMy wife, who is deeply passionate about music, was especially touched by the performances. We both felt completely recharged \u2014 as if we had stepped out of time and into a calm, joyful escape. It didn\u2019t feel like summer anymore; it felt like serenity.\n\nThank you for such an amazing experience. These are the memories we\u2019ll carry with us for a long, long time!\n\nImprovement: need to restrict for birds in swimming pool , it's can be infected the people who swim in the pool",

The property has an old-world charm that instantly makes you feel like you\u2019ve stepped back in time, yet it\u2019s equipped with all modern comforts. The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated, and well-maintained, offering a perfect blend of heritage and comfort.\n\nThe lush gardens and open courtyards are a delight to walk through, and the peaceful ambience makes it a perfect escape from the city\u2019s hustle. The staff is extremely warm, courteous, and always ready to help with a smile. The breakfast spread was fresh and delicious, with plenty of local and continental options.\n\nAs its right between the heart of Jaipur city, its well connected to all the tourist places. Overall, Diggi Palace is a charming heritage hotel that offers an authentic Rajasthani experience \u2014 highly recommended for anyone visiting Jaipur!",

That was a pleasant surprise. Ambience of the rooms is very traditional and reminds of old world charm. The rooms were nothing short of royalty. Kids were very excited to see peacocks on the property. Open lawns and lush green surroundings in monsoons were absolute breather for us.\n\nStaff- Staff is very courteous and soft spoken. They were very attentive and were always smiling.\n\nFood- Since, i was traveling from Hyderabad, i found the food absolutely delicious. The spices were moderate and I would rate it 10/10. The property also organised puppet show, music and cultural dance at night.\n\nLocation- Location of the property is quite good and near to all prominent places in Jaipur.\n\nOverall a great stay and I would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Jaipur. Thank you Diggi Palace for making our stay memorable. (I was not asked to give my review. All views here are my personal experience).",

I was nervous and unsure how the trip would go. But from the moment I spoke to Brij Nest, all my worries started to fade.\n\nI called to request an early check-in because my train was reaching at 11:15 AM. Without any hesitation, they said, \u201cMa\u2019am, you can come before 12, we\u2019ll keep the room ready for you.\u201d This simple reply filled me with peace and comfort. While other places said no, Brij Nest welcomed me with open arms.\n\nWhen I reached and entered the suite, I was honestly speechless. The room was spotless, beautifully designed, and so spacious. I have very high cleanliness standards and even carry my own bedsheets, towels, and slippers. But here, everything was so clean and perfect \u2013 it felt like they understood exactly what I needed.\n\nThere was a smart TV for my baby\u2019s favorite shows, big windows with lovely views, and lots of space for him to play. But more than anything, it was the staff\u2019s kindness that touched me the most.\n\nEvery single person there treated us like family. They noticed small things without us even asking. When we ordered tea, they brought a chocolate for my baby. During breakfast, they saw I was struggling to manage him, and one of them brought a soft toy to keep him busy \u2013 and then gave it to him as a gift. I was truly moved.\n\nThe bathtub in the room was a blessing. My son enjoyed it so much, and seeing him happy made me happy too.\n\nWhat really made this place special was the way the staff cared for us \u2013 not because they had to, but because they truly wanted to. Every little detail showed their thoughtfulness. We never had to wait. We never had to ask twice. Their warmth, patience, and care made all the difference.\n\nI was scared to travel alone with a toddler, but Brij Nest turned my trip into a beautiful memory. It felt nothing like a hotel \u2013 it felt like a home full of kind hearts.\n\nTo the amazing team at Brij Nest \u2013 thank you for everything. You didn\u2019t just give us a stay, you gave us comfort, peace, and unforgettable kindness. I will always be grateful.\n\nWith all my heart,\nThank you. \ud83d\udc96",

You can easily get public or private transport. Ample space to park your car on the road side.\nI stayed in Royal suite. It is spacious, extremely clean, all electronics devices were working, this is important as my experience is not very good at other places but in Laxmi Vilas all provided equipments and devices are in working condition.\nPool is small but sufficient for the guests. I never found it crowded.\nRoom service is exceptional\nI had rooms with BF but a bit disappointed with the taste and quantity. Breakfast was not as per my expectation and quantity was very less in dinner\nThey can also facilitate private 2 or 4 wheeler on your request at nominal charges.

            "text": "I stayed at Laxmi palace with my family for 2 nights. I booked 2 Royal suits.\nLocation is very convenient. Near to MI Road and Bapu/Johri bazar. You can easily get public or private transport. Ample space to park your car on the road side.\nI stayed in Royal suite. It is spacious, extremely clean, all electronics devices were working, this is important as my experience is not very good at other places but in Laxmi Vilas all provided equipments and devices are in working condition.\nPool is small but sufficient for the guests. I never found it crowded.\nRoom service is exceptional\nI had rooms with BF but a bit disappointed with the taste and quantity. Breakfast was not as per my expectation and quantity was very less in dinner\nThey can also facilitate private 2 or 4 wheeler on your request at nominal charges. I saw somewhere Rs 499 per day for 2 wheeler\nConsidering all above reasons, i would like to stay at Laxmi Palace again and highly recommend to others",

            "text": "Recently I went to Jaipur for a mini vacation, and I had booked this hotel for my stay, for 3 days.\n\nMy stay at Sarovar Portico Hotel in Jaipur was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm hospitality and excellent service. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well-appointed with all the necessary amenities, including a safety locker and a king-sized bed. The staff was always available to assist with any requests, and the room service was prompt and efficient.\n\nThe hotel's facilities were top-notch, with a beautiful swimming pool and a well-equipped fitness center. The food and drink options were also impressive, with a multi-cuisine restaurant and a bar serving delicious dishes and refreshing drinks. The hotel also offers a complimentary Wi-Fi service, allowing me to stay connected with my work and personal life.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the gastronomical experience offered by the hotel. The Pavilion restaurant offered a wide range of international and national cuisines that tantalized my taste buds. The Sunset Bar was the perfect place to unwind with a drink while enjoying the breathtaking view of Jaipur's landscape.\n\nThe only problem we had. This hotel was at a distance of 10km from Jaipur city. But due to the availability of the metro, we were a little comfortable. The staff was also helpful in arranging transportation and providing local information.\n\nOverall, my stay at Sarovar Portico Hotel in Jaipur was a memorable one, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in the city. The hotel's excellent facilities, warm hospitality, and gastronomical experience made it one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.\n\nOur check-in time was 2:00 pm after noon, but on my request they gave us check-in at 10 am. Which we liked the most.\n\nI would definitely recommend you to stay at this hotel.",

( Thought our rooms were booked by company)  so be prepared to pay full amount for your stay before experiencing the actual stay.\n\nIn this review, I will provide a detailed account of my stay,\n\nLocation and Accessibility: The Fern Hotel is conveniently located in the heart of Jaipur, making it easily accessible from major transportation hubs such as the airport and railway station. Situated in a prime area, the hotel offers proximity to popular attractions, shopping centers, and business districts, making it an ideal choice for both leisure and business travelers.\n\nRoom Comfort and Amenities: My room at The Fern Hotel was so small that hardly one person can manage there.The furnishings were stylish but not provided with ample space for relaxation. If you're planning to go with your family please take care accordingly. specifically if you get room on 7th floor here then please be ready to give up your entire night sleep as you'll hear continuous sound of pool water in your room. The room was well-equipped with modern amenities such as a flat-screen TV, a minibar, and a safe, but no space to walk also.\n\nService and Staff: The service at The Fern Hotel deserves special mention. The staff members were warm, welcoming, and attentive to every detail, making me feel like a valued guest throughout my stay.\n\nDining Experience: The hotel offers a range of dining options that cater to diverse culinary preferences.The restaurant's ambience was sophisticated, and the staff provided excellent service, further enhancing the overall dining experience.\n\nFacilities and Amenities: I'll not much word on this section.

Despite the fact, that I have never been woken up in any hotel ever, to be told to come to breakfast, it was rather disturbing to see, that, after we rushed down to breakfast, to finish on time, guests still poured in after us and were served well past 10:45h.\n\nWhile I did not really mind the noisy fridge (as we didn\u2019t need it and I simply unplugged it) and dripping air conditioning, which was promptly fixed after my advice to the manager, my family definitely minded the noisy hammering from the construction work in preparation for a big event on Saturday night at Clarks Amer Hotel (which Brij Nest seems to be a part of), which lasted until approx. 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. Having raised this issue with the general manger on Saturday morning, I accepted his apology and believed him, when I was told that he would ensure that there would not be any further construction noise the following night.\n\nLittle did we know, that the celebration event on Saturday night would actually be twice as noisy as the hammering during the night before, but when the event eventually finished shortly after 2 o\u2019clock, I was more than appalled to hear hammering again, which lasted up to around 2:30 a.m. . When we had to leave the hotel at 5 a.m. to go to the airport, one can surely imagine that my family and I were less than happy to have been kept awake until this time, only to have to get up after only approx. two and a half hours of sleep. Not only did these two nights tarnish our impression of the hotel, but it also ruined our day of departure, as we had to catch up on sleep upon our arrival at our hotel in Udaipur.\n\nAs I was not able to speak to the hotel manager at 5 a.m., the time of our departure, I contacted the hotel by email, to raise this issue. The hotel did not see it necessary to reply to my email.\n\nOverall, the hotel seems to have potential to become a 5 star boutique hotel, but currently I believe that a 3 star rating is more appropriate. Being in the direct vicinity of the Clarks Amer Hotel, which seems to be a very popular event hotel (during our stay there was a engagement reception, a Game of Thrones themed party and the Star Miss Teen India 2023 finals), don't expect peace and quietness during your stay.",

The hotel is aggressively marketed online as a luxurious standalone 5-star boutique hotel with independent facilities, amenities, and services. However, upon arrival, I was appalled to discover that the entire premise on which this property is being sold is a farce. Brij Nest is not an independent hotel at all; it is merely a secondary building located within the premises of Hotel Clarks Amer, Jaipur. It does not have a separate reception, separate management, or even basic services of its own. All services\u2014right from food to housekeeping\u2014are routed through Clarks Amer, and guests are frequently required to walk or be transported to the main Clarks premises for meals, gym access, and other promised \u201cluxury\u201d facilities. This setup is not only deceptive but constitutes a clear case of consumer fraud and misrepresentation. The property is masquerading as an independent 5-star hotel while in truth piggybacking on Clarks Amer\u2019s infrastructure, without disclosing the same anywhere during the booking process.\n\nMISLEADING CLAIMS AND FRAUDULENT ADVERTISING\n\nThe listing falsely states that Brij Nest is a 5-star hotel, has all amenities on-site, is a separate hotel with its own premises, and offers 24x7 in-room dining, among other things. Every single one of these representations is false. There is no in-house night menu; on requesting one, we were plainly told that no such service exists. There is no independent restaurant, no dedicated concierge, and no visible management of Brij Nest. All of these critical elements are missing\u2014elements that are non-negotiable for any hotel that calls itself 5-star. In reality, Brij Nest functions more like a guesthouse with no operational autonomy and relies entirely on Clarks Amer for even the most basic tasks. This is a textbook example of bait-and-switch, where unsuspecting customers are tricked into paying premium rates for a product that does not exist in the form it is advertised.\n\nUNHYGIENIC CONDITIONS AND LACK OF BASIC SERVICES\n\nAs if the deception about the nature of the hotel was not enough, the condition of the room itself was deplorable. Upon check-in, the room had visibly dirty towels and bedsheets. Even worse, there was waterlogging in one of the bathrooms, and no remedial measures were taken despite complaints. For a hotel charging over Rs. 32,000 for two nights, these conditions are disgraceful. The staff was unresponsive and evasive, with none of the representatives\u2014including those present at Clarks Amer\u2014willing to acknowledge the complaint or provide any formal record of the grievance raised. No duty manager was made available, no complaint register was offered, and the front desk simply ignored requests for documentation.\n\nVIOLATION OF HOTEL CLASSIFICATION NORMS\n\nAs per the guidelines laid down by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, a hotel seeking classification as 5-star must meet strict infrastructure and service requirements, including independent reception, 24x7 dining, room size, facilities, dedicated staff, and more. Brij Nest blatantly violates these parameters. It is masquerading under a false classification, bringing into question whether it has ever been legitimately approved or rated by any government-authorised body. It is imperative that an inquiry be initiated into how this hotel is allowed to advertise itself as a 5-star property when it evidently fails to meet the most fundamental prerequisites for such a rating.\n\nCONCLUSION: A SCAM DISGUISED AS A HOTEL\n\nThis was not merely a disappointing experience; it was an outright scam. The level of misrepresentation, the unhygienic conditions, the lack of facilities, and the complete failure to respond to valid consumer concerns make Brij Nest, Jaipur, wholly unworthy of any booking platform or 5-star label.",

The rooftop pool is great alongside a cafe which serves food, liquor & sheesha but lacks music in day time. The pool is only available for use till 6pm in the evening. Breakfast is good but needs variation. The room locking system is bad, every time you have to Re Tag the NFC card at reception which is a major turn off. They have ample private parking space. They also have an underground club.\nI would highly recommend this place!!!!\nRequest: Start serving few basic Vegan items (dairy free)",

The property itself is stunning, with beautiful architecture and lush gardens that provide a serene atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nThe rooms at Surya Villa are spacious, clean, and thoughtfully designed, with modern amenities to ensure a comfortable stay.

The food was exceptional, offering a variety of dishes that showcased the flavors of Jaipur. Whether it was the traditional Rajasthani thali or the continental options, each meal was a culinary delight.\n\nThe location of Surya Villa is also worth mentioning, as it is conveniently located near many of Jaipur\u2019s top attractions. Whether you\u2019re interested in exploring the historic forts and palaces or shopping for handicrafts in the local markets, everything is easily accessible from the hotel.\n\nOverall, my time at Surya Villa was nothing short of delightful.

I literally filled our bags with many local items ranging from clothes to accessories to home decoration items. Carrying those bags was a challenging task but I was extremely elated to buy them. Coming back to this property, the rooms are lavish and quite big, the location is 10/10, food is just out of the world. They have a lovely roof top and in the evening, they have folk music, dance and puppet show organized for the guests. Dinner is served right there. I will choose this place again if I travel to Jaipur in the future. Another plus point - you can take  tuk tuk at marginal fare to reach the nearby places from here. I just had so much fun travelling in tuk tuk, talking to locals, finding out the famous food outlets etc. One last bit, it's just 10 mins away from Jaipur railway station.",
