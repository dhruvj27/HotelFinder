The team is well coordinated.\n\nThe team goes extra mile to ensure your stay is comfortable and displays warm hospitality. Kudos to the whole team.\n\nIn short if I have to use a single word to describe the team... It ll be probably INCREDIBLE\n\nThey ll go extra mile to make to feel at Home.\n\nRooms\n\nThe rooms are spacious and available with all basic amenities expected in a room. There is a mini fridge available. No issues absolutely. Their is newspaper/magazines/snacks/tea pot with essentials etc etc available and replaced on a regular basis and as and when required. In fact they ll always put some extra/additional items for your comfort and utility.\n\nFood\n\nThe restaurant serves amazing \ud83e\udd29 food and a great spread. The chef's at live counters are extremely friendly and they ll make any dish you require. The team at restaurant is welcoming and displays warmth hospitality\n\nWould highly recommend a stay.  \ud83c\udfaf\n\nSome observations for management -\n\na) Rooms on 6th floor lack proper sound proofing and you can hear TV sounds played by adjacent room. This needs to be addressed. It just requires installing sound proofing materials in between rooms. However no such issues in other floors.\n\nb) Gym, Spa and swimming are available on 6th floor. In my opinion, the Gym needs an upgrade. It is located in a smaller sized area. They should upgrade their gym with additional treadmills and additional multi gym.",

            "text": "The hotel is being run by an amazing team of people right from the guys at the gate (security guys), at reception, restaurant and the housekeeping staff (who rarely get mentioned in any hotel reviews). The team is well coordinated.\n\nThe team goes extra mile to ensure your stay is comfortable and displays warm hospitality. Kudos to the whole team.\n\nIn short if I have to use a single word to describe the team... It ll be probably INCREDIBLE\n\nThey ll go extra mile to make to feel at Home.\n\nRooms\n\nThe rooms are spacious and available with all basic amenities expected in a room. There is a mini fridge available. No issues absolutely. Their is newspaper/magazines/snacks/tea pot with essentials etc etc available and replaced on a regular basis and as and when required. In fact they ll always put some extra/additional items for your comfort and utility.\n\nFood\n\nThe restaurant serves amazing \ud83e\udd29 food and a great spread. The chef's at live counters are extremely friendly and they ll make any dish you require. The team at restaurant is welcoming and displays warmth hospitality\n\nWould highly recommend a stay.  \ud83c\udfaf\n\nSome observations for management -\n\na) Rooms on 6th floor lack proper sound proofing and you can hear TV sounds played by adjacent room. This needs to be addressed. It just requires installing sound proofing materials in between rooms. However no such issues in other floors.\n\nb) Gym, Spa and swimming are available on 6th floor. In my opinion, the Gym needs an upgrade. It is located in a smaller sized area. They should upgrade their gym with additional treadmills and additional multi gym.",

The dinner buffet felt overpriced considering the lack of options and quality.\nRemote Location: The hotel is located on the outskirts and is not well-known even among locals, making commuting and navigation inconvenient.\nSwimming Pool Not Functional: One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the swimming pool, which was non-operational during our stay. This was extremely disappointing, especially since I had promised my daughter a fun pool experience. I had to alter our plans last minute and spend extra money to take my family to a water park instead.\nPoor Housekeeping Service: Despite turning on the \u201cMake My Room\u201d sign before leaving, the room was not cleaned. I had to call housekeeping after returning. Additionally, the staff left an empty glass outside our room, saying it was from the restaurant and someone else would pick it up. It remained there until we checked out the next morning.\nOverall Verdict: With the kind of service and amenities provided, this hotel does not deserve a 5-star rating. At best, it should be rated 3 or 3.5 stars. I would not recommend it for families expecting a premium experience.",

I was extremely stressed about the work I had to get done and I had been travelling for 9 hours, but the moment i finally got to the hotel it was such a breath of fresh air. For starters, the staff is so SO friendly, helpful and accommodating. I believe it was Atul and another gentleman whose name I unfortunately can't remember who greeted us at reception, and the check in process was quick.\n\nPlease keep in mind they have the European plug points, for which I hadnt come prepared. The staff was so incredibly kind that one of staff members went out of their way to accompany us to a shop that had this plug point at 7ish in the night. They didn't have to do that, and yet they did.\n\nOn check out day I was struggling to find a cab at 5.30 am. All the staff that was gathered there assured me and reassured me that they will make sure we find a cab. They even went to the extent of saying if we don't have a cab, one of the staff from the security team who has a tuk will take us to the airport \ud83e\udd79 I can't tell you what a kind staff this hotel has and how helpful they were.\n\nThey even sort out breakfast packs for you if you're unable to stay for breakfast which was the case for me on a few days. If flew twice to India and I chose Cocoon hotel without any doubt on my second trip as well because their customer service and hotel over all is FANTASTIC.\n\nThe rooms are almost like a suite, because you additionally have a kitchen and an attached sitting area with a balcony as well. The beds are incredibly comfortable!\n\nFew things they could improve on would be to have a wider variety of food for the buffet. Their food was more vegetarian based, and the number of dishes at the buffet was limited.\n\nTheir alacarte menu though is really good. I highly recommend their cold coffee and chicken biryani.\n\nOne day upon request they even sent  tomato soup from the dinner buffet up to my room, even though I had just eaten from the buffet lol.\n\nAlso the entire hotel is sparkling clean, which was truly refreshing to see.\n\nThey could have a better selection of shampoos and conditioners as toiletries, because on the bottle it said 'shampoo and conditioner'.\n\nOver all, I will confidently recommend this hotel to anyone any day. They made my stay in Pune one of the most restful trips given that I was in India for some stressful work. Their staff, the gentleman who carried our bags to the rooms, the security team, Atul, Arjun (if I got his name correctly) and the rest of the team at reception were nothing short of fantastic. I don't understand how there are negative reviews on this hotel, because their kindness, prifessionalism, service was amazing. I'm a very picky person that isn't generous with good reviews, unless it was really good; and this place was par excellence. Cocoon hotel Pune, your staff deserves a raise.",

            "text": "Deeply Disappointed - Unacceptable Hospitality at Amanora The Fern\n\nMy experience at Amanora The Fern was incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Across multiple incidents, the lack of professionalism and care from the staff was glaring and what's worse, no real action was taken, even after we brought everything to their attention.\n\nStarting with the food: we ordered breakfast twice, asking for fried eggs and toast. The first time, the bread was not toasted at all. The second time, it came burnt. I had also asked for a portion of mushrooms, which arrived soaked in water, making them completely inedible. The tea was cold both times, we ended up not touching the food at all.\n\nLater that night, we ordered a brownie and confirmed with the chef that it contained no nuts, as I have a nut allergy. He assured us it didn\u2019t. But when the brownie arrived, it was filled with nuts. I had an allergic reaction and had to take medication in the middle of the night. This level of carelessness is unacceptable and honestly dangerous.\n\nThe worst, however, was the blatant violation of privacy. Despite the Do Not Disturb sign being on, the staff kept knocking, ringing the bell and even entered the room while I was inside alone and in the washroom. This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour.\n\nTo top it off, the next morning at 8 a.m the housekeeping woke us up by knocking and ringing the bell again, saying it was checkout time. Our checkout wasn\u2019t due yet and they later admitted it was a mistake meant for another room.\n\nEven after all of these incidents not a single manager checked in with us. No one attempted to take responsibility or offer any kind of gesture not even a complimentary item, discount or genuine effort to fix things. Just a casual \u201csorry\u201d during checkout, as if all of this was normal.\n\nI find this level of service shocking from a hotel under The Fern brand. The staff clearly lacks training, professionalism and basic courtesy. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone. Completely unacceptable experience. Please save yourself the money and time!!!!!",

The service was impeccable, delivered with such genuine warmth and attentiveness that it felt like the staff were personally invested in making our moment unforgettable. They went above and beyond, surprising us with a bottle of chilled champagne and two elegant glasses as per our special request, and the beautifully decorated bed was a touching masterpiece that made our hearts skip a beat. Every interaction with the team was infused with kindness, transforming our stay into the perfect start to a new chapter.\n\nThe food was an absolute delight, elevating our experience to new heights. The chicken stroganoff was a creamy, savory triumph, perfectly balanced and bursting with flavor in every bite. The hot chocolate was a warm, indulgent hug in a mug, rich and comforting, exactly what we needed to cozy up our evening. The rasmalai was divine\u2014soft, spongy, and soaked in a delicately sweet saffron-infused milk that melted in our mouths. And the scoop of vanilla ice cream? Silky, classic, and the perfect sweet note to end our meal. Each dish was crafted with care, making every bite a celebration of taste and texture.\n\nOur room, with its stunning view of the vibrant boulevard, was the ideal backdrop to this unforgettable night. Amanora The Fern didn\u2019t just provide a stay; they created a memory we\u2019ll never let slip from our minds. To the exceptional team, thank you for your outstanding service, culinary brilliance, and for making our night so extraordinarily special.

It was suffocating and we never left the room because of this . I would request the management of shantai to look into this ,as a non smoker who has booked a non smoking room doesn't have to endure this . Apart from that , the hotel is strictly not for 3 adults in a room . They have single cots only and although they say there is a double bed , it's always subject to availability.  The 3rd person has to sleep on the floor and that's a big let down . The breakfast is good , but options are very very limited . Overall a decent stay buy has to improve a lot of things to be considered a decent 3 star hotels which caters to all kinds of customers",

The hall features a gorgeous jhoomar, and there are fresh flowers everywhere, even in the washrooms \u2014 such attention to detail!\n\nA special touch: the foreigner lady playing the violin \u2014 her music just takes your heart away. Whether it\u2019s the view of the swimming pool or the elegance of every corner, this place delivers a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nHighly recommended for those who want luxury, charm, and class in one place.",

Surrounded by lush green hills and offering breathtaking views, this resort provided a serene and peaceful environment that rejuvenated my mind and soul.\nThe resort staff was courteous, friendly, and always ready to assist. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. They were attentive to my needs and provided prompt service throughout my stay. The level of professionalism exhibited by the staff was commendable, adding to the overall positive experience.\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the food at Sorina Hillside Resort. The on-site restaurant served a variety of delicious dishes, prepared with fresh ingredients. The flavors were authentic and mouthwatering, and the dining experience was enhanced by the stunning views from the restaurant.\nThe resort's amenities were well-maintained and catered to various interests. I particularly enjoyed the swimming pool, which provided a refreshing escape from the summer heat.\nAlthough my overall experience at Sorina Hillside Resort was exceptional, there were a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, the Wi-Fi connectivity was a bit weak and inconsistent, which may be a concern for some guests. Secondly, the resort's location, while offering tranquility, is slightly remote, making it necessary to plan ahead for transportation and sightseeing.\nIn conclusion, Sorina Hillside Resort in Panshet, Pune, provided a memorable escape into nature. With its breathtaking views, comfortable accommodations, friendly staff, and delicious food, it offered an idyllic setting for relaxation and rejuvenation. Despite minor areas for improvement, I highly recommend this resort to anyone seeking a peaceful retreat",

The level of professionalism exhibited by the staff was commendable, adding to the overall positive experience.\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the food at Sorina Hillside Resort. The on-site restaurant served a variety of delicious dishes, prepared with fresh ingredients. The flavors were authentic and mouthwatering, and the dining experience was enhanced by the stunning views from the restaurant.\nThe resort's amenities were well-maintained and catered to various interests. I particularly enjoyed the swimming pool, which provided a refreshing escape from the summer heat.\nAlthough my overall experience at Sorina Hillside Resort was exceptional, there were a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, the Wi-Fi connectivity was a bit weak and inconsistent, which may be a concern for some guests. Secondly, the resort's location, while offering tranquility, is slightly remote, making it necessary to plan ahead for transportation and sightseeing.\nIn conclusion, Sorina Hillside Resort in Panshet, Pune, provided a memorable escape into nature. With its breathtaking views, comfortable accommodations, friendly staff, and delicious food, it offered an idyllic setting for relaxation and rejuvenation. Despite minor areas for improvement, I highly recommend this resort to anyone seeking a peaceful retreat",

She provided me with all the necessary information about the hotel's amenities, dining options, and local attractions. The staff's professionalism and friendliness were consistent throughout my stay, making me feel valued as a guest. They also upgraded us to the Seleqtions suite which we felt was a great gesture.\n\nThe Suite was simply stunning! It was spacious, elegantly decorated, and equipped with modern amenities. The comfortable bed ensured a restful night's sleep and the room's cleanliness and attention to detail were impeccable, a true testament to the hotel's commitment to excellence.\n\nThe location of Blue Diamond couldn't be better. It was conveniently situated in Koregaon Park near major attractions and within walking distance of shopping districts and local restaurants. I appreciated being able to explore the city easily and return to the comfort of the hotel without any hassle.\n\nThe buffet was also great with a wide spread. In summary, my stay at Blue Diamond was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of excellent service, luxurious accommodations, delectable dining options, and prime location made it a memorable experience. Ill recommend this hotel if you are visiting Pune.",

She provided me with all the necessary information about the hotel's amenities, dining options, and local attractions. The staff's professionalism and friendliness were consistent throughout my stay, making me feel valued as a guest. They also upgraded us to the Seleqtions suite which we felt was a great gesture.\n\nThe Suite was simply stunning! It was spacious, elegantly decorated, and equipped with modern amenities. The comfortable bed ensured a restful night's sleep and the room's cleanliness and attention to detail were impeccable, a true testament to the hotel's commitment to excellence.\n\nThe location of Blue Diamond couldn't be better. It was conveniently situated in Koregaon Park near major attractions and within walking distance of shopping districts and local restaurants. I appreciated being able to explore the city easily and return to the comfort of the hotel without any hassle.\n\nThe buffet was also great with a wide spread. In summary, my stay at Blue Diamond was nothing short of extraordinary. The combination of excellent service, luxurious accommodations, delectable dining options, and prime location made it a memorable experience. Ill recommend this hotel if you are visiting Pune.",

The hotel is well-located and offers good facilities, making it a convenient choice for business travelers and tourists alike.\n\nLocation & Accessibility\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of this hotel is its prime location. It is centrally situated, making it easy to access from different parts of the city. The railway station is just 3-4 km away, which is a big plus for travelers arriving by train. Additionally, since the hotel is located on the main road, transportation options such as taxis, auto-rickshaws, and public buses are easily available.\n\nAmbience & Reception\n\nThe hotel\u2019s ambience is quite impressive, with well-maintained interiors and a peaceful environment. As soon as you enter, you are welcomed by a decent and elegant reception area. The front desk staff is very professional, friendly, and always ready to assist with a smile. Their warm hospitality makes the check-in process smooth and hassle-free.\n\nService & Parking\n\nThe valet parking service is available, which is helpful, but the parking area is quite limited and a bit congested. The security and valet staff, however, are quick to assist and ensure that guests don\u2019t face any issues while parking their vehicles.\n\nFood & Dining Experience\n\nOne of the highlights of this hotel is its superb food quality. The taste is excellent, and the variety of dishes offered is impressive. Whether you are dining in the restaurant or ordering room service, the food is well-prepared and delicious.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nOverall, this hotel offers a great combination of convenience, comfort, and good service.

The chicken stroganoff was a creamy, savory triumph, perfectly balanced and bursting with flavor in every bite. The hot chocolate was a warm, indulgent hug in a mug, rich and comforting, exactly what we needed to cozy up our evening. The rasmalai was divine\u2014soft, spongy, and soaked in a delicately sweet saffron-infused milk that melted in our mouths. And the scoop of vanilla ice cream? Silky, classic, and the perfect sweet note to end our meal. Each dish was crafted with care, making every bite a celebration of taste and texture.\n\nOur room, with its stunning view of the vibrant boulevard, was the ideal backdrop to this unforgettable night.
