The dinner spread, while decent, leaned more heavily on Indian options.\n\nOne suggestion: While items are clearly labelled with allergen info, I expected clearer separation between vegetarian and non-vegetarian items, especially for people with allergies. For instance, pancakes (with egg) and eggless waffles were placed side by side, with a shared serving tong - increases cross contamination risks. As someone with a severe egg allergy, this was very concerning for me. While the staff always prepared fresh waffles for me on request, the arrangement / layout of dishes didnt change over the 5 days I had breakfast - i expect better allergen awareness and caution from a luxury property.\n\nSpecial mention to Sayantan @ front desk for a smooth experience, Susmita for her personal touch / calls about my experience, Abhisek who served us (during dinner on 7/10). Thanks team!\n\nOverall, it was a memorable stay - but a bit more attention to detail and timely accommodation of guest requests would elevate the experience further!",

Many options for food and drinks as they had about three restaurants within. Breakfast and dinner spread was so varied and widespread; great choices for non vegetarians (their mutton curry with thosai was amazing ) that which we did not enjoy in other hotels that we stayed on our two week trip to Trichy, Pondicherry, Goa and Cochin. Chennai GRT outdid even the Taj Fort Aquada in Goa by leaps and bounds in every aspect; service, ambience, rooms, fast lifts, food and driver\u2019s parking.\nAs for service we wish to mention:\nKathir , Restaurant Manager & Sathish, Senior Executive, who were ever so attentive to both my husband every time  we were in the restaurant for our meals.

Many options for food and drinks as they had about three restaurants within. Breakfast and dinner spread was so varied and widespread; great choices for non vegetarians (their mutton curry with thosai was amazing ) that which we did not enjoy in other hotels that we stayed on our two week trip to Trichy, Pondicherry, Goa and Cochin. Chennai GRT outdid even the Taj Fort Aquada in Goa by leaps and bounds in every aspect; service, ambience, rooms, fast lifts, food and driver\u2019s parking.\nAs for service we wish to mention:\nKathir , Restaurant Manager & Sathish, Senior Executive, who were ever so attentive to both my husband every time  we were in the restaurant for our meals.

A special thanks to RINSA & GEETHA & the entire team of waiters for their warm hospitality \u2013 they were polite, attentive, & made our dining experience memorable.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant if you\u2019re a food lover, especially for kebabs. Definitely worth a visit!",

The property itself is spacious, clean, and very well maintained, with a strong sense of safety and comfort throughout.\n\nThe rooms are large, spotless, and thoughtfully designed, making for a truly relaxing stay. The dining options are fantastic, with multiple restaurants offering a great variety of delicious cuisines. The bar area is a great highlight, with live performances and a vibrant yet classy atmosphere that adds to the overall experience.\n\nI also made use of the spa and gym facilities, both of which are top-notch. The spa services were excellent, and the gym is well-equipped and clean \u2014 perfect for staying on track while traveling.\n\nWhat truly sets this hotel apart is the team of people working here. Every single staff member I interacted with \u2014 from the general manager and front desk team, to the concierge, waitresses, housekeeping staff, security guards, chefs, and kitchen team \u2014 was courteous, professional, and genuinely warm. You can tell there is a real culture of hospitality here. Everyone made an effort to ensure guests feel welcome, comfortable, and well cared for.\n\nA big thank you to everyone at the Hyatt Regency Chennai for making my stay so memorable. Highly recommended whether you\u2019re here for business or leisure!",

We had to call staff to fix it and it took another hour. So instead of checking in at 2pm, we actually got our room ready at 5pm.   Moreover, we got a call from their receptionist who asked us to order something from their restaurant, Tandoori Tamasha.

The location is extremely convenient, especially for those visiting Apollo Hospital, as it\u2019s just a short walk away. The rooms were spotlessly clean, well-maintained, and equipped with all the basic amenities needed for a comfortable stay.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the hospitality of the staff\u2014they were polite, helpful, and always ready to assist with a smile. The check-in process was smooth, and housekeeping was prompt and efficient. Even though the hotel doesn\u2019t have an in-house restaurant, room service was available and there were plenty of dining options nearby.\n\nThe hotel also offers free Wi-Fi, 24-hour front desk support, and ample parking space, which added to the convenience. I would highly recommend The Grand One to anyone looking for a clean, budget-friendly, and centrally located stay in Chennai.",

But what made our experience truly memorable was the warmth, efficiency, and attentiveness of the entire team.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Zakariya at the reception \u2013 always professional, welcoming, kind and very helpful. And a big appreciation for Juel from housekeeping \u2013 always polite and ready to assist. He always promptly brought our online food orders to the room with a smile \u2013 truly commendable service.\n\nWe opted for a room with a kitchen, which made our stay even more convenient. The kitchen had almost all the basic utensils \u2013 even a Mortar and Pestle (Hamandista), which was a thoughtful addition. However, one thing that was missing was a Vessel Holder (Sarashi). Including that would make the kitchen setup even more complete.\n\nIn the room all basic amenities were well provided, and the daily housekeeping service kept everything clean and comfortable. We especially appreciated that anything we needed was just a phone call away \u2013 the reception team responded immediately.\n\nWe noticed that only on some floors had the refrigerator outside at one corner of the floor. So, we specifically chose our room based on the fridge placement and the staff kindly accommodated our preferences.\n\nA small suggestion: the bathroom tiles in the shower area get a bit slippery when wet, although it\u2019s limited to just that section and not the entire bathroom. It would be great if this could be addressed to enhance safety.\nAlso, the exhaust fan feels slightly underpowered for the bathroom size.\n\nEven though this is a late review, the hospitality and comfort we experienced are still fresh in our minds. We\u2019re already planning to stay at Grand One Tower again on our next visit to Chennai.\n\nA well-managed, peaceful and guest-friendly Business Class Hotel \u2013 highly recommended!",

            "text": "The Perfect Grand Finale \u2013 A Royal Experience at The Leela Palace Chennai\n\nAs someone who planned this trip through South India for my wife and in-laws, I really wanted to end it on a high, somewhere luxurious, relaxing, and memorable for the whole family. The Leela Palace Chennai absolutely delivered on every front and then some. It was the perfect send-off to a beautiful journey.\n\nWe stayed in the Royal Club sea-facing rooms, and honestly, they were breathtaking. Watching the sun rise over the Bay of Bengal from our balcony each morning felt surreal, calm, peaceful, and something we\u2019ll never forget. The rooms were beautifully appointed with every detail carefully thought out plush bedding (a pillow menu), luxurious bathrooms, and that view... just wow.\n\nOne of the best parts of the stay was access to the Royal Club Lounge* Each afternoon we\u2019d make our way down for their high tea service, which had the perfect mix of savoury bites, sweets, and warm service. Then in the evening, it was time for cocktail hour, which quickly became our little daily ritual. Special shoutout to Esther, who took incredible care of us every single day. She remembered our preferences, always had a smile, and genuinely made us feel so welcome. Her kindness didn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\nBreakfast every morning was another highlight. The buffet was extensive, from South Indian classics like dosas and idlis to international favourites like pancakes and made-to-order eggs. The staff were incredibly attentive, always making sure our table had what we needed, topping up coffee without being asked, and checking in to see if we were enjoying ourselves.\n\nWe also spent an evening at Library Blu, the hotel\u2019s signature bar, and were seriously impressed. The space is beautifully designed, and the cocktails were out of this world, inventive, unique, and packed with flavour. The bartenders clearly take pride in their craft, and every drink was a work of art. We ended up trying a few different options just because everything was so good.\n\nBut what truly made this stay so exceptional was the people. I can\u2019t thank Shomali, the manager, and Karthik, the butler services supervisor, enough. From pre-arrival coordination to last-minute requests, they made sure every little detail was handled seamlessly. They were always available, incredibly responsive, and genuinely cared about our experience. It honestly felt like we were staying in a palace, but being looked after by family, that\u2019s the kind of warmth and service they provided.\n\nAs the person who organised this trip, I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to end it. My in-laws were glowing with joy, my wife was relaxed and happy, and I got to sit back knowing we were all in the best hands possible. The Leela Palace Chennai exceeded every expectation.\n\nEven the transport to the airport at the end of the trip was a delight, both our drivers went above and beyond to ensure a seamless and relaxing drive to get on our flights, only to be met at the airport by David who took care of our entire check in process.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for luxury that doesn\u2019t feel stiff or impersonal, somewhere where the service is heartfelt, the food is incredible, and the setting is pure elegance, this is where you want to be.",

Nestled along the serene Adyar estuary and overlooking the Bay of Bengal, the hotel is not just a place to stay\u2014it is an immersive experience in refined grandeur, Southern tradition, and world-class service.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of regal splendor. The architectural elegance of the palace is striking, blending classical South Indian elements with contemporary luxury. High domes, ornate carvings, vast courtyards, and water features create an ambiance of timeless opulence. The check-in process was seamless and discreet, with warm traditional welcomes, refreshing towels, and jasmine garlands\u2014a gesture that immediately set the tone for the days ahead.\n\nI stayed in a Premier Sea View Room, and waking up to the stunning panoramic views of the Bay of Bengal was a highlight every morning. The room was spacious, tastefully furnished, and equipped with every imaginable amenity\u2014plush bedding, a marble bathroom with a soaking tub, high-speed Wi-Fi, mood lighting, and a smart entertainment system. Turndown service was prompt and thoughtful, with personalized touches like hand-written notes and local sweets.\n\nDining at The Leela Palace is nothing short of a gastronomic journey. Spectra, the all-day dining restaurant, offered a global buffet with live counters and impeccable service. Jamavar, their Indian fine-dining restaurant, delivered an exquisite culinary exploration of regional Indian flavors. The chefs were more than willing to customize dishes to my preferences, and the sommelier curated excellent wine pairings with each course. Milled coffee and homemade dosas for breakfast became a daily ritual that I\u2019ll truly miss.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of this property is its people. Every staff member\u2014from housekeeping to butlers, spa attendants to restaurant servers\u2014radiated professionalism, warmth, and a deep pride in the Leela legacy. Service was anticipatory without being intrusive, and their attention to detail was flawless.\n\nThe spa deserves special mention. The ESPA therapies, tranquil setting, and seasoned therapists created a sanctuary of relaxation. I also used the pool and fitness center daily, both of which are beautifully maintained and offer calming views of the sea.\n\nSecurity was unobtrusive yet reassuring, ideal for business leaders, celebrities, and international dignitaries who frequent the property. The concierge team was exceptional in organizing meetings, shopping experiences, and guided city tours tailored to my interests.\n\nAfter a week at The Leela Palace Chennai, it\u2019s clear why this hotel remains the gold standard for luxury in South India. It\u2019s not merely the architecture or amenities that make it special, but the harmony of cultural authenticity, heartfelt hospitality, and attention to detail. Whether you\u2019re a discerning traveler, a corporate guest, or a family seeking refined indulgence, The Leela Palace Chennai is an experience that will linger long after you\u2019ve checked out.",

Overall, I had a fantastic stay and would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for its convenient location near the central railway station.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Abdul for graciously allowing me to extend my stay by an hour as a complimentary gesture. Much appreciated!",

From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming atmosphere that set the tone for a perfect stay.\n\nThe service at Ilara Hotel and Spa Tada is truly outstanding. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that every need was met. They were attentive, professional, and always had a solution to any request. Whether it was arranging transportation, suggesting local attractions, or simply catering to my preferences, their commitment to customer satisfaction was truly remarkable.\n\nNow let's talk about the food. The hotel's restaurant offered a wide range of delicious dishes that catered to various tastes. Each meal was a culinary delight, showcasing a blend of flavors that left my taste buds wanting more.

But what made our experience truly memorable was the warmth, efficiency, and attentiveness of the entire team.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Zakariya at the reception \u2013 always professional, welcoming, kind and very helpful. And a big appreciation for Juel from housekeeping \u2013 always polite and ready to assist. He always promptly brought our online food orders to the room with a smile \u2013 truly commendable service.\n\nWe opted for a room with a kitchen, which made our stay even more convenient. The kitchen had almost all the basic utensils \u2013 even a Mortar and Pestle (Hamandista), which was a thoughtful addition. However, one thing that was missing was a Vessel Holder (Sarashi). Including that would make the kitchen setup even more complete.\n\nIn the room all basic amenities were well provided, and the daily housekeeping service kept everything clean and comfortable. We especially appreciated that anything we needed was just a phone call away \u2013 the reception team responded immediately.\n\nWe noticed that only on some floors had the refrigerator outside at one corner of the floor. So, we specifically chose our room based on the fridge placement and the staff kindly accommodated our preferences.\n\nA small suggestion: the bathroom tiles in the shower area get a bit slippery when wet, although it\u2019s limited to just that section and not the entire bathroom. It would be great if this could be addressed to enhance safety.\nAlso, the exhaust fan feels slightly underpowered for the bathroom size.\n\nEven though this is a late review, the hospitality and comfort we experienced are still fresh in our minds. We\u2019re already planning to stay at Grand One Tower again on our next visit to Chennai.\n\nA well-managed, peaceful and guest-friendly Business Class Hotel \u2013 highly recommended!",

It would be great if this could be addressed to enhance safety.\nAlso, the exhaust fan feels slightly underpowered for the bathroom size.\n\nEven though this is a late review, the hospitality and comfort we experienced are still fresh in our minds. We\u2019re already planning to stay at Grand One Tower again on our next visit to Chennai.\n\nA well-managed, peaceful and guest-friendly Business Class Hotel \u2013 highly recommended!",

The hotel's amenities were top-notch, providing everything I needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\nThe reception staffs, particularly Shibu the dining staff were incredibly friendly and efficient. They made the check-in process seamless and were always available to assist with any queries or requests I had throughout my stay. Their professionalism and dedication truly made a difference in my overall experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food! The hotel boasted some of the best food I have ever tasted, rivaling even the finest 5-star standard restaurants. The variety and quality of the dishes were exceptional, catering to a range of culinary preferences. I was thoroughly impressed with the presentation, taste, and attention to detail in every meal I had.\n\nThe hotel staff baggage carrying staff, wallet parking staffs and cleaning staff including the reception staff and the ladies responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, were outstanding. The bed sheets and towels were of the highest quality, providing a luxurious and comfortable sleep experience. The cleaning staff ensured that my room was always spotless and well-maintained, creating a pleasant and hygienic environment.\nThe amenities, especially the swimming pool and gym, played a major role in maintaining fitness enthusiasm. With state-of-the-art equipment and a variety of exercise options, the gym provided a perfect space for individuals to work on their strength and endurance. The swimming pool, on the other hand, offered a refreshing and low-impact way to stay active and improve my health Additionally, the availability of these amenities made it convenient for people who wanted to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being.\n\nOverall, my stay at Radisson Blue Egmore Chennai was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel provided a truly memorable experience that was worth every penny. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and enjoyable stay in Chennai.\nLastly, I would like to suggest that you ask guests upon arrival whether they would prefer smoking or non-smoking rooms according to their requirement.",

Strategically perched in the heart of corporate Chennai, the location is ideal \u2014 not just for leisure but for business travellers as well. From the moment you enter, you're greeted with that familiar Hilton charm \u2014 the signature scent, gleaming chandeliers, elegant flooring, and timeless interiors. But what truly sets this property apart are the genuinely warm smiles that welcome you \u2014 the kind that makes you feel right at home.\n\nRooms: Contemporary and smart, with a perfect blend of homely warmth and upscale aesthetics. Of course, the much-talked-about Hilton Comfort Bed lived up to its reputation with deep sleep guaranteed.\n\nF&B: For food lovers, Hilton Chennai is a hotspot. Their curated food specials, like the Friday seafood buffet and Rajasthani food festivals, are favourites with locals and guests alike. Their stylish, vintage jazz-inspired bar and the buzzing rooftop club by the pool only add to the charm. I recommend increasing menu real estate for local cuisine, supported by staff training on each dish. The regional offerings are unique, and this is a competitive edge few hotels in the area currently doing not have. What made our stay truly memorable was the gold-standard service \u2014 from the efficient front desk to the magical room service team.\n\nSpecial callout to the front desk, the security staff (always with a namasthe and smile), room service Magic and house keeping staff. Shantanu from the front desk was warm and brought quick resolution to challenges. Hilton Chennai \u2014 you were a delight. We\u2019ll be back.",
