Bed was king but the sheet was for Queen. It was not tucking properly. Had to call room service to fix the bed everytime.\n\nThe food was average, serving similar food almost everyday. One morning I took few fruits but it was rotten it had smell. Although they changed immediately but it was there job to check the quality. The most shocking moment came on our last day when my wife saw a cockroach on a buffet plate \u2013 I had to personally inform a staff member to remove it. This could have cost life if the cockroaches are on the buffet plate.\n\nAlthough a few staff members were polite and tried their best, the overall experience was unacceptable.

Bed was king but the sheet was for Queen. It was not tucking properly. Had to call room service to fix the bed everytime.\n\nThe food was average, serving similar food almost everyday. One morning I took few fruits but it was rotten it had smell. Although they changed immediately but it was there job to check the quality. The most shocking moment came on our last day when my wife saw a cockroach on a buffet plate \u2013 I had to personally inform a staff member to remove it. This could have cost life if the cockroaches are on the buffet plate.\n\nAlthough a few staff members were polite and tried their best, the overall experience was unacceptable. What should have been a joyful anniversary celebration ended up disappointing. For the amount what my wife paid for the suprise especially for the decoration and room upgrade, the service and quality were nowhere close to the expectations. Sadly, I would not return or recommend this place to anyone.",

I would never recommend this hotel, better you pay 1000 extra and take up better players of hospitality industry. I had the interaction with one of their night shift incharge some Mr sayyed and he promises me of something and the very next morning he refrained from having any such conversation they think a customer will just make up a whole conversation, no cooperation from the staff. They have a tariff difference between their own website and in the hotel premises and if you book via website and their own website not any third party app they will say we don\u2019t anything we don\u2019t know what to do etc. if you feel like being tortured then only check in into this hotel",

Shops, restaurants, and essential stores are all close by, whatever you need is just a short walk away.\n\nRooms & Amenities:\nThe rooms are excellent. Even the standard category room is spacious and includes a bathtub, which is a rare offering these days. The room features a 50\" TV with OTT platforms already subscribed, a separate coffee table with two chairs, a dedicated work desk with an office chair, and two telephones viz. one near the bed and the other at the work desk.\n\nThe hotel provides all essential toiletries and accessories, along with thoughtful amenities like a bathrobe, slippers, iron with ironing board, hairdryer, and a mini bar. Everything is well maintained and neatly arranged.\n\nDining:\nThe property houses three restaurants. I tried the breakfast buffet and was amazed by the variety, so many options that I couldn't try everything even over a three-day stay! Each dish I tried was delicious and well-prepared.\n\nOn our first evening, we dined at OPM, one of the in-house restaurants. The service was prompt, and the staff was courteous. The food was excellent \u2014 especially the honey-glazed lotus stem starter, which was a unique and memorable dish for me. The ambience was elevated by live singing and soft music, creating a very pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe following evening, we visited the restaurant on the first floor. While the food was fine, the loud sound didn\u2019t suit our mood, so we didn\u2019t stay long.\n\nFacilities:\nI used the gym and swimming pool, which were well-maintained. I couldn\u2019t try the spa, sauna, or steam room this time \u2014 but those are definitely on my list for the next visit.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, The Accord Metropolitan offers a great blend of location, comfort, service, and dining. I highly recommend it for both business and leisure travelers.\n\nThanks for reading! Feel free to check out the photos and do like and follow for more reviews.",

Breakfasts were good where Paul and Randeep (the waiters) were very attentive. The gym was small but well maintained and sufficient for a good workout. The swimming pool looked good but nowhere did it state you have to take a towel from the room. There are also no changing rooms other than the toilets adjacent to the pool which were not ideal.

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was struck by the elegant lobby, which exudes warmth and sophistication. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and the staff\u2019s welcoming demeanor immediately made me feel at home.\n\nThe rooms were another highlight of my stay\u2014spacious, well-maintained, and thoughtfully designed. Every detail, from the comfortable bedding to the modern amenities, was curated to ensure a relaxing and comfortable experience. The cleanliness and upkeep of the rooms were impeccable, adding to the overall charm of the stay.\n\nThe restaurant, especially during breakfast, was a standout experience. The vibrant ambiance, immaculate cleanliness, and inviting atmosphere set the perfect tone for the day. The breakfast spread was impressive, featuring a wide variety of dishes to cater to every taste. Whether it was the freshly baked pastries, the assortment of cereals, the selection of seasonal fruits, or the hot dishes showcasing both local and international flavors, everything was prepared with great care and attention to detail. Each bite reflected a commitment to quality and excellence.\n\nWhat truly elevated the experience, however, was the outstanding service provided by the Food and Beverage team, led by the Head of Food and Beverage (Not able to remember his name) His genuine warmth, attention to detail, and dedication to guest satisfaction were evident throughout my stay. While I regret not remembering his name, his efforts to personally ensure every guest felt valued and well taken care of were remarkable. He took the time to check in with guests, making sure all F&B offerings were not just available but served promptly and with care.\n\nThe entire F&B team went above and beyond to accommodate individual preferences and dietary needs, adding a personalized touch to the dining experience. Their ability to maintain such high standards of service, even during the busy breakfast hours, was truly commendable and added a memorable layer to my stay.\n\nIn summary, Hotel Citadines offers a perfect blend of comfort, exceptional service, and culinary excellence. From the welcoming lobby and well-appointed rooms to the delightful breakfast experience, every aspect of the stay was carefully curated to ensure a memorable visit. I highly recommend Hotel Citadines to anyone looking for a stay where hospitality and attention to detail are truly prioritized.",

They went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.\n- *Parking:* The parking facilities were convenient and well-maintained.\n\n- *Food Pricing:* While the food was good, I found it to be a bit pricey.

However, considering the exceptional service and amenities, I felt it was worth the investment.\n\n*Overall Experience:*\nDespite the minor pricing concerns at restarants, my stay was truly exceptional. The staff and amenities all combined to create a memorable experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\n*Rating:*\n- *Cleanliness:* 5/5\n- *Service:* 5/5\n- *Amenities:* 5/5\n- *Value:* 4/5 (due to pricing concerns)\n\nThank you to the entire team at Citadine for a wonderful stay!

                "text": "Excellent Stay at Citadines !\nI recently had the pleasure of staying at Citadines, a City view property, and I must say that it was an exceptional experience!\n\n*Highlights:*\n\n- *Staff:* The staff were incredibly friendly, approachable, and provided top-notch service. They went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.\n- *Parking:* The parking facilities were convenient and well-maintained.\n\n- *Food Pricing:* While the food was good, I found it to be a bit pricey. Consider offering more competitive pricing or promotions to make it more accessible to guests.\n- *Room Pricing:* Similarly, the room rates were slightly higher than expected. However, considering the exceptional service and amenities, I felt it was worth the investment.\n\n*Overall Experience:*\nDespite the minor pricing concerns at restarants, my stay was truly exceptional. The staff and amenities all combined to create a memorable experience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable stay.\n\n*Rating:*\n- *Cleanliness:* 5/5\n- *Service:* 5/5\n- *Amenities:* 5/5\n- *Value:* 4/5 (due to pricing concerns)\n\nThank you to the entire team at Citadine for a wonderful stay! I look forward to returning in the future.",

            "text": "Even after four days of departing, the exceptional service, delicious cuisine, and remarkable professionalism of this hotel remain vivid in my memory.\n\nNestled away from the main road, the hotel offers a tranquil retreat, free from the noise of traffic and horns\u2014a feature I truly appreciated. During my stay, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Parthipan, the Manager. His responsiveness to feedback was astounding; one of my suggestions was implemented across all rooms in less than 24 hours! When I experienced WiFi issues, he promptly provided a dongle, exceeding my expectations of simply logging a complaint for the IT team.\n\nThe food at the hotel was a gastronomic delight, offering the finest quality and flavour. I invited a friend to the dinner buffet, and he was equally impressed. A connoisseur who often dines at one of India's most prestigious five-star hotels, he praised the freshness and exquisite taste of the fish, noting it surpassed that of his usual five-star venue.

During my stay, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Parthipan, the Manager. His responsiveness to feedback was astounding; one of my suggestions was implemented across all rooms in less than 24 hours! When I experienced WiFi issues, he promptly provided a dongle, exceeding my expectations of simply logging a complaint for the IT team.\n\nThe food at the hotel was a gastronomic delight, offering the finest quality and flavour. I invited a friend to the dinner buffet, and he was equally impressed. A connoisseur who often dines at one of India's most prestigious five-star hotels, he praised the freshness and exquisite taste of the fish, noting it surpassed that of his usual five-star venue.

The hotel offers state-of-the-art meeting rooms equipped with all the necessary amenities for a successful business gathering. The staff was incredibly attentive, ensuring that every detail was taken care of, allowing us to focus solely on our agenda. The seamless coordination and impeccable service truly made our meetings productive and enjoyable.\n\nNow, onto the stay experience \u2013 it was simply outstanding. The rooms were spacious, elegantly furnished, and provided a serene retreat after a long day of meetings. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the room, from the plush bedding to the modern amenities. The housekeeping staff maintained impeccable cleanliness throughout my stay, ensuring a comfortable and hygienic environment.\n\nAnd let's talk about the highlight of my culinary experience \u2013 the mutton biryani. Oh, it was nothing short of a gastronomic delight! The flavors were perfectly balanced, the meat tender, and the aroma tantalizing. It's no wonder that it's a special mention \u2013 a dish that truly deserves all the praise it receives.\n\nOverall, my time at The Accord Metropolitan was beyond exceptional. The combination of top-notch meeting facilities, luxurious accommodation, and mouthwatering cuisine makes it a standout choice for both business and leisure travelers alike.

Among the many wonderful places to stay, Accord Metropolitan has become my favorite for the past year, and it has been an exceptional experience every single time.\n\nThis hotel has a unique way of making you feel completely at home, blending comfort, care, and impeccable service. The smallest details are taken care of with great attention and thoughtfulness. I am especially grateful to Charles and his team for the early morning breakfasts that always start my day on a positive note. A special mention also goes to Mr. Katyal and his dedicated team, who consistently go above and beyond to ensure everything is perfect, never missing an opportunity to assist and make you feel valued.\n\nIf you're visiting Chennai and are looking for a place that pampers you just like home, Accord Metropolitan is undoubtedly the place to be. Their warmth, professionalism, and personal touch make every stay truly memorable. Thank you to the entire team for making my visits so delightful!",

The complimentary breakfast buffet was a culinary delight, offering a diverse menu that catered to both South Indian and Western tastes. Special mention to Mr. Sridhar at the travel desk, whose exceptional assistance during a storm ensured our safety and a seamless extension of our stay. Despite citywide power cuts, the hotel maintained an uninterrupted power supply, showcasing their commitment to guest well-being. The housekeeping by Mr. Rajaguru and overseen by Mr. Senthil, excelled in maintaining a pristine environment. Dining at Jai Hind restaurant was a highlight, with the \u00e0 la carte menu providing a convenient and delicious culinary experience. Overall, the fantastic service and attention to detail by the staff, especially Mr. Sridhar, Mr. Rajaguru, and Mr. Senthil, made our stay memorable.

Located in the heart of the city, this iconic hotel offers the perfect blend of comfort, luxury, and outstanding hospitality.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully designed with modern amenities. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night\u2019s sleep. The views from our room were spectacular, offering a glimpse of Chennai\u2019s vibrant skyline.\n\nThe hotel boasts a variety of dining options, and each restaurant exceeded my expectations. The breakfast buffet was a highlight, with an impressive spread of South Indian delicacies, continental dishes, and fresh juices. Special mention to the courteous staff who ensured every meal was a delightful experience.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the staff\u2019s attentiveness and professionalism. They went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, from the seamless check-in process to their readiness to assist with every request.\n\nWhether you\u2019re traveling for business or leisure, Savera Hotel is a fantastic choice. Its central location, luxurious accommodations, and exceptional service make it one of Chennai\u2019s best hotels. We can\u2019t wait to return on our next visit to the city!\nSpecial shout out to Mr Lawrence with the guest services who was always making sure that we were comfortable.

The hotel's modern and well-maintained rooms, coupled with the exceptional service provided by the dedicated staff, created a truly comfortable and enjoyable living environment.\n\nSpecial commend to the housekeeping staff, Ramesh and Vishnu, and their team leader Subash for their impeccable service.\n\nThe food and beverages Manager Vijay Anderson & staff Momitta, Chaidal, Bibek, Karan, Ratika & Hrita were excellent in their roles, ensuring a smooth dining experience. Especially Momitta and Chaidali, were always friendly and efficient, anticipating my needs and delivering food on time. Bibek was also excellent at room service, ensuring prompt and reliable delivery.\n\nChef Raj's signature beetroot yogurt was truly a culinary delight, a standout dish among the many delicious options available.\n\nI also want to acknowledge the helpfulness of the General Manager, Abdul Hakeem who was always available to assist with any issues or concerns. Their timely responses and proactive approach ensured a smooth and stress-free stay.\n\nThe hotel's convenient location near the Little Mount metro station added to its appeal, providing easy access to various parts of the city.\n\nWhile there were occasional minor inconveniences like lift issues or construction noise, these were overshadowed by the overall positive experience.\n\nI felt incredibly safe stay. Despite the lower occupancy during Diwali, I felt secure and well-protected staying alone in a single room. The staff was attentive and the hotel's security measures were reassuring.\n\nBloom Hub Guindy successfully transformed my extended stay into a comfortable and hassle-free period.\n\nIf you're looking for a hotel in Chennai that offers a pleasant and safe stay, I wholeheartedly recommend Bloom Hub Guindy.",
