It was cool and nice experience with food and services let me share details like live Panjabi food restro inside the hotel also we have option to choose order the food inside one more resto inside the hotel. Pool experience was average due to no crowd and timings mismatch of mine. But spa facility are currently not in operation so that was bit disappointed. If I would say about the staff and location it was very nice and easy to reach on road property respectively as we have asked reception to pack the breakfast due to our early morning flight so they support and provide us, thanks!.

The staff went above and beyond to ensure every need was met with warmth and professionalism. The food was a highlight ‚Äî an expansive and diverse buffet featuring top-quality dishes that catered to every palate. Each meal felt like a culinary experience!

The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well-appointed, offering a relaxing retreat after a day of indulgence. Every detail, from service to ambiance, was thoughtfully curated.

Absolutely loved every moment of our stay ‚Äî this is hospitality at its finest. Highly recommended!",2025-05-03T10:31:35.796906Z,4 months ago
pun002,pun002_r2,Tanvi Dubey,4,"I‚Äôve stayed at Hyatt Pune a couple of times now, including this year and last. It‚Äôs located close to Aga Khan Palace, not too far from the airport or Phoenix Mall, which makes it convenient for work or quick errands. This is an older property compared to the newer Hyatt Pune Residences nearby, and that shows in the interiors. The rooms are spacious, but the dark wood d√©cor makes them feel smaller and almost crampped. Still, they‚Äôre well equipped with a study table, high back chairs and footstool, wardrobe, and a clean bathroom unit with shower and sink.

The pool area is nicely done and located next to their spa and salon. The salon is run by Arya, and I‚Äôve used it during work trips it‚Äôs great to have those services available when you‚Äôre short on time and need something basic for hair or skincare. They also have a Blue Tokai coffee counter in the lobby, which is a plus if you like good coffee and are coming from cities like Bangalore.

The food, however, is something I feel doesn‚Äôt quite match up to five-star standards, not just at Hyatt but across many luxury hotels in Pune. That said, the Asian restaurant has a pleasant vibe‚Äîespecially at night when the water wall is lit up‚Äîand the food is decent. One small touch I appreciated was at breakfast, where they placed a tiny glass bowl with a single fish on tables where people were dining alone. It was thoughtful and not something you see often.

Staff is courteous and helpful. Check-in was smooth, and they were proactive in helping with things like flower arrangements when we needed them. Overall, it‚Äôs a good property, especially for work trips, with a few thoughtful touches that stand out.",2025-05-21T06:28:46.126423Z,3 months ago

The food quality was good, especially the breakfast spread, which had a wide variety of fresh, flavorful options.
The rooms, however, are on the smaller side . While they are well-designed and clean, those who prefer more spacious accommodations might find them a bit compact.

pun003,pun003_r2,Shabbir Das,5,"Banquet hall was amazing. It's a great place to hold corporate meetings or conference for a small group of 60-70 people.

Service at the breakfast counter was slow depending on the audience. If the banquet hall was booked for a conference meeting of 60 people with breakfast, the staff should anticipate 60 people to be there at the breakfast table with the residing guests.

pun003,pun003_r3,Arjit Gupta,4,"Recently booked the hotel for one day and had a decent experience but not at par with its price. Few things that disappointed me was-
1. The room was not properly maintained, there was left over hairs in bathroom.
2. They provided some very cheap coffee sachets and milk powder sachets.
3. Breakfast was below my expectation, less varieties, and many items were not fresh at all.
But few things that i liked were..
1. The view from the room was awesome.
2. The room service was quick.
3. They allow outside food. (Many hotels with this price range don't.)
4. The staff behaviour was very cordial.
I booked this hotel at a very discounted price @ ‚Çπ3.6k.(including breakfast) Thats why i am giving 4 star. It does not worth more than 4k. (As of now)
I hope in future they improve maintenance and also breakfast.",2025-07-29T05:29:10.758235726Z,a month ago
pun003,pun003_r4,Saksham Tiwari,1,"stayed at St. Lauren recently, and unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. Let me break it down point by point so future guests know what to expect:

1. Cockroaches in the room ‚Äì Imagine checking in and finding these unwelcome ‚Äúroommates.‚Äù Not the kind of hospitality I was expecting.

2. Swimming pool hygiene ‚Äì The pool was dirty, and even after complaining, it took the hotel staff an entire day to clean it. Definitely not guest-friendly.

3. Used shaving kit ‚Äì Shockingly, the kit provided had hair stuck to it. Reusing toiletries for guests is unacceptable and unhygienic.

4. Deceptive photos ‚Äì Don‚Äôt go by the glossy pictures online. The property is old, worn-out, and needs serious maintenance.

5. Food quality ‚Äì The food was okay, but not excellent. For the price and branding, I expected much better.

6. Non-smoking confusion ‚Äì I booked a non-smoking room, but later realized the entire hotel is non-smoking. To top it off, they have warnings everywhere about a ‚Çπ5,000 penalty if you smoke. Felt more like a restriction than hospitality.

7. Room service ‚Äì To be fair, this was the only saving grace. The staff attending the room were polite and prompt.

Overall, my stay was a letdown, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to anyone looking for comfort and value for money.",2025-08-16T13:09:01.293656126Z,3 weeks ago
pun003,pun003_r5,Rajan Mahajan,3,"The Hotel is okay. I stayed from 2/7 to 4/7 in Room 402. As soon as I entered the Hotel the giant blowers above the reception tried to push me out of the Hotel. I did not understand the purpose of these blowers but the blow was certainly not pleasant.
Both days I had to call for bath & hand towel which was surprising. The bath towel was torn. The carpet in the corridor was not clean.
Restaurant serves good Food.
In Buffet Breakfast I found that the arrangement of Juice Jars was incorrect. The jars are placed (in water) behind sandwiches, dhokla and cut fruits. When any of the jar is picked up the water at the outer bottom of the jar drips on the food ( sandwiches, dhokla and cut fruits).  I brought it to the notice of the duty manager. I hope the arrangement has been changed.
All in all not a very pleasant stay.",2025-07-10T06:43:48.933688503Z,a month ago

The Orchid Hotel truly exceeded all expectations ‚Äî a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and outstanding service. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome with their warm hospitality and professional demeanor.

I wouldn‚Äôt miss the chance to thank the hotel manager for helping me out of an unpleasant situation. When I first entered my room, there was a strong, unpleasant odor. I reported it to the reception, and while they tried to fix it with a room spray, it didn‚Äôt help much. Later, I figured out the smell was coming from the carpet. Upon raising the issue again, they quickly shifted me to another room with tiled flooring. That room was much better, and I could enjoy the rest of my stay comfortably.

Staff was more helpful.
Only the pain for was nearby signal traffic. For which one has to keep patience in peak hours. For bikes, entrance gate is different as compared to cars.

My room was located in to other wings and which passes through multiple banquet hall.

The bathrooms are old and needs upgrade , bathtubs were rusted, the water was dripping we had raised a complaint no of times but no help ... Facilities dint reach even after 4 calls and 1 hour wait... Water is not hot it's just lukewarm...
For the hotel category and pricing it's just a deluxe hotel good for professional visits ..
The only thing they have gone well is the outside sitting and swimming pool
Rooms are small for the price, AC is centralised but takes like 4 hrs before it increases by even 1 degrees.

No signature Citrus fragrance anywhere in the property. Lighting is dim. Entry to the room is through a dingy set of stairs. Like walking through a store room.

Housekeeping standards are poor, by Bloom standards. Who wants to see the dinner plates in the hallway at 8AM?

In short if I have to use a single word to describe the team... It ll be probably INCREDIBLE

Some observations for management -

a) Rooms on 6th floor lack proper sound proofing and you can hear TV sounds played by adjacent room. This needs to be addressed. It just requires installing sound proofing materials in between rooms. However no such issues in other floors.

b) Gym, Spa and swimming are available on 6th floor. In my opinion, the Gym needs an upgrade. It is located in a smaller sized area. They should upgrade their gym with additional treadmills and additional multi gym.",2025-06-25T14:03:28.725693803Z,2 months ago

Firstly, the positives:

The reception staff was extremely humble and supportive, making the check-in and overall experience very pleasant.

The restaurant service was commendable, with delicious food and courteous staff.

The room ambiance was excellent ‚Äì it was well-scented, had a great view, and was kept tidy.

Room service was prompt, and the staff were polite and professional.

It was also appreciated that the room was stocked with a sufficient number of water bottles.

Areas for improvement:

There was no handwash provided in the bathroom, which is a basic hygiene requirement.

Shampoo and body wash supplies were insufficient for the duration of the stay.

A safety concern: where the wooden and tile flooring meet, a nail was protruding from the floor. Unfortunately, I injured myself twice due to this and had to take a tetanus injection as a precaution.

I hope these points are taken in the right spirit to improve the overall guest experience. Despite the mentioned issues, I appreciate the hospitality and look forward to better arrangements on my next visit.",2025-07-04T10:55:06.236556168Z,2 months ago

However, there are a couple of areas for improvement. The vegetarian starter options were limited, and we would have appreciated a bit more variety for our vegetarian team members. Also, the refilling time for a few dishes was slightly slow, which caused a bit of a wait during peak lunch hour.

I stayed at E-Square The Fern, Pune with my wife and daughter from August 15 to 17, 2025, and unfortunately, the experience was far from what one would expect from a hotel claiming to be 5-star.

Here are the key issues we faced:

Limited Food Options: The breakfast and dinner buffet had very limited variety, especially for vegetarians. The dinner buffet felt overpriced considering the lack of options and quality.
Remote Location: The hotel is located on the outskirts and is not well-known even among locals, making commuting and navigation inconvenient.
Swimming Pool Not Functional: One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the swimming pool, which was non-operational during our stay. This was extremely disappointing, especially since I had promised my daughter a fun pool experience. I had to alter our plans last minute and spend extra money to take my family to a water park instead.
Poor Housekeeping Service: Despite turning on the ‚ÄúMake My Room‚Äù sign before leaving, the room was not cleaned. I had to call housekeeping after returning. Additionally, the staff left an empty glass outside our room, saying it was from the restaurant and someone else would pick it up. It remained there until we checked out the next morning.
Overall Verdict: With the kind of service and amenities provided, this hotel does not deserve a 5-star rating. At best, it should be rated 3 or 3.5 stars. I would not recommend it for families expecting a premium experience.",2025-08-19T10:53:08.476675809Z,2 weeks ago

The hotel itself is lovely ‚Äî great ambiance, warm hospitality, and excellent restaurants. I truly appreciated the thoughtful upgrade to a suite, which was a wonderful gesture. The personalized welcome in the room ‚Äî a platter of rose petals, soothing bath salts, and a handwritten note ‚Äî reflected the attention to detail and care from the housekeeping team.

However, my experience was significantly impacted by the lack of hot water in both the shower and the wash basin. When I say no hot water, I mean completely cold ‚Äî not even lukewarm. Despite raising the issue twice and following up with a third reminder over a 24-hour period, the problem remained unresolved. I was repeatedly assured it would be fixed, but unfortunately, it wasn't.

To the hotel‚Äôs credit, the senior staff at checkout were apologetic and took the time to engage with me about the issue.

The venue offered a spacious banquet hall with a comfortable cluster-style seating arrangement. There was ample space allocated for both the bar counter and the food counters, ensuring a seamless experience.

pun032,pun032_r1,Prasad Mahajan,1,"Detailed Review ‚Äì Itsy Hill View Hotel üö´

My stay at this hotel was nothing short of a nightmare. I chose this property with certain expectations of basic comfort and hygiene, but what I experienced was shocking, unacceptable, and disgraceful for any establishment calling itself a ‚Äúhotel.‚Äù

1. Bed Issue ‚Äì False Promises and No Action

I explicitly requested and booked a king-sized bed. Instead, I was given two single beds pushed together. When I raised this issue, the staff promised to change the room the next day, but despite multiple follow-ups, no action was taken. This shows both carelessness and dishonesty on management‚Äôs part.

2. Unhygienic Bed Sheets and Linen

The bed sheets, blankets, pillows, and covers were filthy‚Äîfull of stains, foul-smelling, and clearly not washed for a long time. I complained repeatedly and requested replacements, yet not once were they changed. This is basic housekeeping, and even budget accommodations manage to do this.

3. No Room Cleaning at All

Throughout my stay, the room was never cleaned even once. An already smelly and uncomfortable space only became more unhygienic and suffocating. This shows a complete lack of housekeeping standards.

4. Non-functional TV

The in-room TV did not work properly. After effort from room service, it barely started, but most channels were unsubscribed and the few that worked kept freezing. This is pointless and misleading advertising of ‚Äúamenities.‚Äù

5. Faulty AC ‚Äì Noisy and Malfunctioning

The AC was ancient, noisy, and malfunctioned throughout the night. It made scratching sounds that interrupted sleep, and its cooling was very poor. Instead of comfort, it added more disturbance.

6. Bathroom Infestation & Bedbugs

The bathroom was crawling with cockroaches coming from the sink holes, freely moving across the floor. On top of this, the bed had bedbugs‚Äîa serious health and safety violation. Such conditions are hazardous and completely unacceptable in any hospitality service.

7. Torn Curtains and Zero Privacy

The curtains were torn, unclean, and looked like they had not been replaced in years. When I opened them, a gust of dust came out. With transparent windows facing the road, the torn curtains allowed direct sunrays into the room and completely compromised privacy. This was not just inconvenient, it made the stay unbearable.

8. Pathetic Breakfast Quality

Breakfast was tasteless, poorly prepared, and of very low quality. The so-called ‚Äúhot beverages‚Äù were nothing but hot water. For a hotel to serve such substandard food is insulting to guests.

Final Note

This hotel is in desperate need of complete renovation, strict pest control, staff retraining, and new management. The staff were unresponsive and dismissive despite repeated complaints.

I strongly warn fellow travelers: do not book this hotel under any circumstance‚Äîeven if it were offered for free. It is unhygienic, mismanaged, and unsafe.",2025-08-26T16:12:52.308384686Z,a week ago

Rooms :
Rooms are good... They are just good, a lot smaller than what I had expected and don't feel worthy for the amount you pay to stay at the hotel... They are not that luxurious.

Service :
Room service : The treatment at the hotel is good. The room cleaning service is fine. The hospitality is really well managed. All the feedback is well considered and made sure that they are followed well and respected.

Laundry Service : The laundry and pressing are the worst services, there are high chances of clothes getting spoiled after the wash and pressing... I lost 2 of my t-shirts.

Complimentary pickup and drop-off to office is very well managed and right on-time always.

Food :
Best for Breakfast - Idli, Poha, Fruits... Parathas and Dosas from the live counter are served hot and taste authentic. English breakfast option is also made available and croissant ü•ê, beans, scrambled eggs, cakes and lot other options are available.
Best for In Room Dining - Peas masala, Dhal Tadka, Panner tandoori are served well and taste great Babycorn pepper dry (not in the menu) but the chef custom made this for me and it was great.

pun036,pun036_r3,james s,4,"Our four-day stay at The Westin was our first experience with this esteemed brand, and we arrived with the high expectations that naturally accompany a luxury five-star hotel. Celebrating our anniversary, we were simply looking for a relaxing staycation to unwind and enjoy each other's company.

For the most part, our experience was indeed lovely. The hotel undeniably possesses the hallmarks of a five-star establishment. The food and drinks were a definite highlight, and we particularly enjoyed the extensive breakfast buffet. However, if you're planning a longer stay like ours, be aware that the buffet options might become a tad repetitive. The hotel also boasts excellent amenities, including a spa that we thoroughly enjoyed. Our balcony room was comfortable, featuring an exceptionally comfortable bed and prompt service whenever we requested it. The staff across the hotel were consistently polite and courteous.

However, our stay was unfortunately punctuated by a series of unexpected hiccups that left us somewhat surprised, especially given the hotel's reputation. On one occasion, I was quite taken aback to find a piece of glass in my food during the breakfast buffet. While the staff were quick to apologize and address the situation, it was certainly a concerning incident.

My wife's experience with the salon was also disappointing. Despite enquiring a day in advance about curly hair products for a hair spa, the salon was unable to accommodate her needs. Furthermore, one day our room was missed during the cleaning service, even after we had specifically requested it. On our final night, we requested room service to clean our room upon our return, only to find that while the bed was tidied, the rubbish, trays, and the balcony remained untouched.

Speaking of the balcony, while it was a nice addition to our room, it ultimately felt underwhelming. Furnished with just a simple table and chairs and offering no shade from the intense daytime sun, it was unusable during the day. In the evenings, the abundance of mosquitos made it equally uninviting. The view from our room was also just satisfactory, with nearby buildings obstructing the sunrise.

Despite these issues, I must acknowledge the hotel's commendable service recovery efforts. The staff consistently apologized for each incident and genuinely tried their best to rectify the situations. This proactive approach to service was definitely appreciated.

Ultimately, our anniversary staycation at The Westin Koregaon Park was a blend of positive and negative experiences. While the hotel offers many of the luxuries and services one expects from a five-star establishment, the series of unfortunate incidents we encountered during our short stay was surprising. It leaves us questioning whether it was simply bad luck or if there are underlying inconsistencies. While we appreciated the good aspects like the food, the comfortable room, and the polite staff, and especially their attempts to make things right, the repeated issues did detract from the seamless and relaxing experience we had hoped for. The salon, in particular, could benefit from better-trained staff who are knowledgeable about all the services offered.",2025-04-24T12:14:16.599869Z,4 months ago

pun041,pun041_r2,Sharath Pindi,1,"- The hotel is absolutely unhygienic.

- Did not even explain where is the breakfast & also thus could not consume. The lift of the hotel was closed for service most of the times during evening hours.

- Check-in was not smooth at all. I was asked to pay more towards my room nights since the credits that was shown to me on as paid was not reflected in the system thus room was also denied initially.

- The rooms were with cockroaches all over the place and it crawls on my bed at night.

- There is no pest control whatsoever. I myself killed close to 4 to 5 Roaches as they were found in the room.

- The rooms were kept dirty even when I was checked in & had bad stench/ Odour .

- Stained & bad conditioned bed and bathroom linen.

- There was a blood stain on my pillow which was offered to one my first day of check-in.

- The bathroom closet and the floor were unclean. Fixtures were either leaky or did not have enough pressure.

- When I reached out for a room cleaning, I was answered by them in a rude way and also denied to clean the room with a reason being that there was no HK staff available during evening hours.

- When raised an escalation, I was denied for a hotel with better condition only because I was not in the price segment which were good hotels. However, I have been promised a refund for unused nights. But this is not service recovery for the damage! I¬† The area managers were really not that helpful.

However, in midst of all this, I want to call out - Ritesh & Mohit from customer¬†service team who really tried to support and assist that was possible within their capabilities.",2024-01-12T16:11:19.582232Z,a year ago
pun041,pun041_r3,Prateek Bharadwaj,1,"The hotel pictures shown and the reviews given on the app/website are misleading and managed. The hotel looked dingy and substandard to say the least.

The first room that I was allotted had cockroaches crawling on the floor, so I promptly requested for another room.

The second room that they gave me was worse. There were no toiletries and I had to request for soap and towel. The bed mattress was old and I caved in the minute I sat on it. The corner walls of the room had tobacco spit stains and cobwebs, the toilet was dirty and looked unhygienic with stains everywhere. The shower was broken.

The TV remote had no batteries in it and was broken. I tried turning on the TV manually, but in vain.

I had opted for paid breakfast, and when I asked for it in the morning, I was told the kitchen is closed and that they don't serve breakfast.

I can go on and on. Fab Hotels should atleast do a basic check of the property before posting it on their website. Is this the experience you provide to your customers? Even though I had booked for second night, I decided not to check-in because of my horrible experience.

I made a big mistake by booking through FAB Hotels.

I wish there existed a NEGATIVE RATING option.
Booking a room here would mean harassing yourself.
1) Rooms are not at all clean and hygienic. Spit marks, cobwebs, you can discover all such things here.
2) Bathrooms - Apart from not being clean at all, the flush and shower are not working, the bucket has algae on it, and the floor has significant black marks. I can just go on.
3) They have this non - refundable booking policy which is their own way of looting customers.
4) No support from ""24x7 customer care support"". I tried to call them like a hundred times. This is really pathetic.
5) Breakfast option - ONLY POHA. No provision of drinking water
5) No signboard outside the hotel. The image on maps is edited.

Tv remote isn't there. You need to switch it on manually which wasn't informed to me earlier. Ac not working properly.
Then comes their highlight - Buffet breakfast. So there was puri bhaji, upma, canned juice, cornflakes, bread butter jam. It all looked a little unhygienic. There staff there isn't welcoming and warm at all. They will put one plastic water bottle at your table during breakfast. Not even a glass with it. I could only have puri bhaji as I'm a vegan. Upma was not good at all. There were no fruits, no fresh juice which is very basic at any buffet breakfast.
There is no help in terms of luggage. No one is present during checkout. Young kids are chilling outside.

I recently stayed at Tattva suits and I‚Äôm genuinely impressed. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. The front desk staff were warm, efficient, a small gesture that set the tone for the entire stay.

üõè Room:
Our room was spotless, modern, and beautifully decorated. The bed was incredibly comfortable with high-quality linens, and the view from our balcony ‚Äî overlooking the pool and garden ‚Äî was breathtaking. The daily housekeeping was prompt and discreet.

üçΩ Food:
The breakfast buffet was outstanding with a wide range of continental and local dishes. Every meal at the in-house restaurant was amazing üòç

üìç Location:
Perfectly situated ‚Äî  as we wanted to stay near the city area where we can get things very easily....

üôå Service:
The staff went above and beyond. I loved the way they treated us and helped with every thing we need

pun049,pun049_r1,Lewis Cardenas,4,"The property itself is beautiful and the service throughout my stay was very good. As a Diamond member I was upgraded to an executive room, which was appreciated, although I had hoped for a suite to truly experience the full Conrad touch. Unlike my experience at the Conrad Bengaluru, there was no welcome note waiting in the room, no small treats or snacks, and the upgrade felt more standard than special.

Breakfast was lively and at times quite busy, but the quality of the food was very good and worth the wait. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful amenities. I especially liked how the power outlets were conveniently placed and adaptable to international standards, which made things much easier as a traveler. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which is always a welcome detail after a long day.

The hotel is also very conveniently located, making it a great choice for both business and leisure. Overall it was a pleasant stay, but I left wishing there had been a few more of those signature touches that usually set Conrad apart.",2025-08-18T02:13:21.821412833Z,2 weeks ago

pun050,pun050_r4,ASHIJEET UPADHYAY,1,"So, this wasn't my 1st stay at any hotel affiliated with FAB, even I'm staying in Fab Hotels since it's inception.
But this was the most ugliest experience of all, I can recall my experience in the below points:-

1. Starting from the location of the hotel, I would really like to not recommend this hotel to any one, either it be couples, families or groups, because the location is way worse than you can ever imagine, you have to go through the slums, and if you're pretty rich with some big car like swift etc, you can't even reach the location with your car, you've to park it somewhere outside, which is not even safe.

2.check in process- So, the hotel FabExpress DDPK Ajay Inn has recently started some 3 months ago, as informed by the front desk manager, and he wasn't looking happy with his job there too üòÇüòÇ, which I can understand by his Management of the business. He took around 60- 70mins just for the check in and lead us to the room. Because he was unable to keep a count on his work force also, which is also really hilarious.
3. Hotel is 3months old, so with the new infrastructure, they have no clue of how to run it, and let me assure you, the room size which you saw in the enticing and lavishing pics are not really real, all that is a dogma.

4. Staff behaviour:- It was really hard to see any courtesy and mannerism in the staff, for which Fab chain is popular. Employees and staffs are not at well mannered, punctual or groomed.
I stayed at this hotel for 4days, and they never even bothered to clean the facilities provided.

5. Strictly , not recommended for the couples and families, because they don't even have kitchen facility so again and again you have to buy food from outside, which you can't eat in your room too, according to their ugly policy.

6. According to their advertisement, they provide you the power backup for 24hours, believe me, it's all fake.

7. As I've already mentioned that, this isn't my first stay at any fab, so with the standards and quality kept in mind, which i received from others, I would really appreciate if you do not go for this hotel, as you can even get far better than this, in Viman Nagar.

That's it guyz. Thank you. Cheers.",2018-12-09T13:34:46.827064280Z,6 years ago

Toilet seats need urgent renewal. These all can be done easily with a little surveillance by Treebo hospitality chain which has taken over it. Just taking over a property doesn‚Äôt end your job. Breakfast should have more options and honestly they shouldn‚Äôt charge extra for eggs in a breakfast menu, it was ridiculous.  One of the few advantages of this hotel is it's location and second, it‚Äôs woman- friendly vibe. Good availability of nearby food joints, the locality is clean and safe, there is a shopping mall and a rooftop bar in walking distance. Chaturshringi Devi Temple is worth a visit for its view of the city from the hill.  Overall, it's good if you have some other work in the city, staying out all day and coming back to hotel past evening and have a good sleep. Hot water available 24*7. They provide electric kettle, mosquito repellents and toiletries on demand.  And beds are comfortable, not at all full of bed bugs contrary to some reviews. But there are cockroaches who are happily residing in the rooms, fortunately in my case, they didn't come up on the bed, or even if they have had, I was asleep and ignorant about it. There is a cat which meows in the night along the corridor, gives some thrill anyways.

I had a very disappointing experience at Recedency Club, Pune ‚Äî a property that falsely projects itself as a premium establishment charging five-star rates, but fails miserably when it comes to basic hygiene and customer service.

During my earlier stay, I encountered bed bugs in the room, which was both shocking and unacceptable for a place that charges such high prices. I shared my honest review online, only to be personally requested by Ms. Carol at the reception to remove it, with the assurance that pest control measures would be taken immediately and such issues would not happen again. Believing in their word and commitment to improvement, I took down the review in good faith.

However, on my recent trip to Pune, I reached out to Ms. Carol again to rebook the same room, hoping to see improvements firsthand. To my surprise, I was met with a completely unprofessional and dismissive attitude. They showed no courtesy, no intention to address my concerns, and no willingness to even speak professionally. Clearly, once the review was gone, so was their accountability.

This kind of behavior is not only unethical but also speaks volumes about how little they value guest safety, trust, and basic human dignity. Adding to my concern, this property is associated with the same family involved in last year‚Äôs tragic Porsche accident that resulted in the loss of innocent lives ‚Äî a fact that adds an unsettling context to how little regard they seem to have for people‚Äôs wellbeing, both within and outside their premises.

I am writing this review again not out of frustration, but to warn future guests to think twice before trusting the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù claims made by Recedency Club Pune.

pun059,pun059_r3,Ishita Sinha,3,"The hotel is on the cheaper side and by no means a 3-star. The room I stayed in was huge, although I don't know if all rooms are equally big. The bed was big and comfortable, too. AC and fan were working fine, but the lights were not all working. There was one small mirror in the room where you can just see your face, but no dresser. There was another slightly bigger mirror in the bathroom above the basin. The whole room stank of some kind of spirit or paint thinner and my belongings all started smelling of the same thing by the second day. It was difficult to sleep because of that constant smell. Opening the windows was possible, but the windows did not have any bars, so I did not feel safe doing that. There was a set of very old and expired set of coffee, sugar, milk packets, which had ants all over them. I did not try and find out if the kettle worked. They did provide soap and towels, but no toothpaste. Hot water came only after draining the pipes of about two buckets of water, so to shower, I had to make sure I had the time to drain enough water (which I mostly reused for flushing the toilet) and wasn't in a hurry. The toilet flush worked fine, btw. The bathroom was also quite huge. As for food, there is a breakfast buffet which is supposed to be included with your stay, but I was charged for the first day, because apparently I reached before check-in time and had the breakfast which was supposed to be for the ""previous day"", even though I checked out at night and didn't need the breakfast of the ""next day"", which I would have assumed to compensate for my first day's breakfast. But I was charged anyway. My room was not cleaned during my stay, but I'm not sure if they would clean it if I asked them to (I didn't ask).

Absolutely the Worst Resort Experience Ever ‚Äì A Complete Nightmare!

I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews, but this place was so unbelievably horrible that I feel obligated to warn others. Where do I even start?

The staff were beyond pathetic ‚Äî rude, unprofessional, and shockingly drunk on duty. It felt unsafe being there, especially with such careless and intoxicated people running the place.

The room? Disgusting. Filthy floors, stained sheets, and a stench that made it impossible to relax. The washroom looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in weeks ‚Äî mold, hair, and dirt everywhere. Truly unhygienic and a health hazard.

This wasn‚Äôt just a bad experience; it was a disaster. It felt like we were trapped in some horror movie version of a resort. Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to risk your safety, your sanity, and your health. Should be shut down permanently.

pun069,pun069_r3,Rebecca Abeysinghe,5,"I traveled to India in the month of July, and staying at this hotel was truly one of the best decisions I made. I was extremely stressed about the work I had to get done and I had been travelling for 9 hours, but the moment i finally got to the hotel it was such a breath of fresh air. For starters, the staff is so SO friendly, helpful and accommodating. I believe it was Atul and another gentleman whose name I unfortunately can't remember who greeted us at reception, and the check in process was quick.

Please keep in mind they have the European plug points, for which I hadnt come prepared. The staff was so incredibly kind that one of staff members went out of their way to accompany us to a shop that had this plug point at 7ish in the night. They didn't have to do that, and yet they did.

On check out day I was struggling to find a cab at 5.30 am. All the staff that was gathered there assured me and reassured me that they will make sure we find a cab. They even went to the extent of saying if we don't have a cab, one of the staff from the security team who has a tuk will take us to the airport ü•π I can't tell you what a kind staff this hotel has and how helpful they were.

They even sort out breakfast packs for you if you're unable to stay for breakfast which was the case for me on a few days. If flew twice to India and I chose Cocoon hotel without any doubt on my second trip as well because their customer service and hotel over all is FANTASTIC.

The rooms are almost like a suite, because you additionally have a kitchen and an attached sitting area with a balcony as well. The beds are incredibly comfortable!

Few things they could improve on would be to have a wider variety of food for the buffet. Their food was more vegetarian based, and the number of dishes at the buffet was limited.

Their alacarte menu though is really good. I highly recommend their cold coffee and chicken biryani.

One day upon request they even sent  tomato soup from the dinner buffet up to my room, even though I had just eaten from the buffet lol.

Also the entire hotel is sparkling clean, which was truly refreshing to see.

They could have a better selection of shampoos and conditioners as toiletries, because on the bottle it said 'shampoo and conditioner'.

Over all, I will confidently recommend this hotel to anyone any day. They made my stay in Pune one of the most restful trips given that I was in India for some stressful work. Their staff, the gentleman who carried our bags to the rooms, the security team, Atul, Arjun (if I got his name correctly) and the rest of the team at reception were nothing short of fantastic. I don't understand how there are negative reviews on this hotel, because their kindness, prifessionalism, service was amazing. I'm a very picky person that isn't generous with good reviews, unless it was really good; and this place was par excellence.

pun070,pun070_r4,shivani kamat,1,"Deeply Disappointed - Unacceptable Hospitality at Amanora The Fern

My experience at Amanora The Fern was incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Across multiple incidents, the lack of professionalism and care from the staff was glaring and what's worse, no real action was taken, even after we brought everything to their attention.

Starting with the food: we ordered breakfast twice, asking for fried eggs and toast. The first time, the bread was not toasted at all. The second time, it came burnt. I had also asked for a portion of mushrooms, which arrived soaked in water, making them completely inedible. The tea was cold both times, we ended up not touching the food at all.

Later that night, we ordered a brownie and confirmed with the chef that it contained no nuts, as I have a nut allergy. He assured us it didn‚Äôt. But when the brownie arrived, it was filled with nuts. I had an allergic reaction and had to take medication in the middle of the night. This level of carelessness is unacceptable and honestly dangerous.

The worst, however, was the blatant violation of privacy. Despite the Do Not Disturb sign being on, the staff kept knocking, ringing the bell and even entered the room while I was inside alone and in the washroom. This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour.

To top it off, the next morning at 8 a.m the housekeeping woke us up by knocking and ringing the bell again, saying it was checkout time. Our checkout wasn‚Äôt due yet and they later admitted it was a mistake meant for another room.

Even after all of these incidents not a single manager checked in with us. No one attempted to take responsibility or offer any kind of gesture not even a complimentary item, discount or genuine effort to fix things. Just a casual ‚Äúsorry‚Äù during checkout, as if all of this was normal.

I find this level of service shocking from a hotel under The Fern brand. The staff clearly lacks training, professionalism and basic courtesy. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone. Completely unacceptable experience. Please save yourself the money and time!!!!!",2025-08-07T18:24:28.555180035Z,a month ago

Every interaction with the team was infused with kindness, transforming our stay into the perfect start to a new chapter.

The food was an absolute delight, elevating our experience to new heights. The chicken stroganoff was a creamy, savory triumph, perfectly balanced and bursting with flavor in every bite. The hot chocolate was a warm, indulgent hug in a mug, rich and comforting, exactly what we needed to cozy up our evening. The rasmalai was divine‚Äîsoft, spongy, and soaked in a delicately sweet saffron-infused milk that melted in our mouths. And the scoop of vanilla ice cream? Silky, classic, and the perfect sweet note to end our meal. Each dish was crafted with care, making every bite a celebration of taste and texture.

Terrible Experience ‚Äì Avoid This Place

We booked 5 rooms, and due to an emergency, one room had to check out a day early. Despite informing the staff, we were still charged for the full stay. When we tried to resolve the issue, the staff were rude, unhelpful, and kept blaming Booking.com instead of taking any responsibility. Their attitude was completely unprofessional and dismissive. The manager had no courtesy to respond to the request rather they vanished post our discussion because their duty hours ended.

The property itself is not very well maintained. Rooms have no ceiling fans‚Äîonly ACs, making it either freezing or stuffy.. For a hotel, this is ridiculous.

To top it off, they charged our credit cards without any prior notice or approval. That‚Äôs a huge red flag and completely unacceptable.

I recently had a Solo Business Trip to Pune where I had a corporate booking for few days at Quality Inn Mint. I'd stayed in the suite room that was basically a 1 BHK Apartment with all essential amenities like Refrigerator, Microwave, Electric Kettle Utensils - A living / Dining room, A Bedroom with attached Balcony, and Washroom. It was a lavish & comfortable stay for me. I'd a very early check-in, at 4 AM , but the hotel staffs were cooperative & hospitable enough to help me with everything & make me feel safe & welcome! Special mentions for the Food - the breakfast buffet has lots of varieties- had ordered in dinner and all tastes yummy! I totally loved the hospitality of all the staffs, swift room service and the ease of location near the Airport.
Thanks Quality Inn Mint for making my stay comfortable & pleasurable!

First room they gave me was worse when I found out tv was not working they gave me a new room which was ok . They have a small menu and I ordered something from it . First time it took more than 2 hours for them to serve it next time I got it within 30 min . They explained it the staff who served me was so nice he convinced me so good I love that guy . Front desk guy was also nice he have a cute husky. Hotel is ok but not worth for the money. Lower the price or make it more convenient as a three star hotel .

Let's break it down:

We walked into this supposed ""5-star"" resort expecting luxury, but what we got was a joke. No lobby? Are you kidding me? All the activities, pool, and restaurant are 200m away uphill, and don't even get me started on the lack of transportation services. What about seniors? Did you even think about them?

The food at the clubhouse restaurant was disgusting. We waited forever for a table, and when we finally got our food, it was a letdown. And don't even get me started on the swimming pool. We get there and they're telling us we need a cap, which nobody informed us about earlier. And of course, they've got a shop selling them for 200 bucks each. What a rip-off!

But the cherry on top was when our car got punctured during checkout. We asked the staff for help, and they couldn't care less. No emergency services, no nothing. We had to struggle to find a mechanic, and after 3 hours, we finally managed to get one. And guess what? The hotel staff took his number for ""future reference"". Unbelievable.

The OSHO International Meditation Resort in Koregaon Park, Pune, offers a one-of-a-kind spiritual and wellness experience unlike any traditional ashram. Spread across a lush, beautifully designed 40-acre campus, the resort blends meditation, modern living, and nature seamlessly. The architecture is minimalist yet luxurious, with meditation halls, water bodies, Zen gardens, and serene pathways that create a deeply calming atmosphere.

The resort offers a structured daily schedule with over 10 types of meditations including Osho Dynamic Meditation, Kundalini, Nadabrahma, and the famous Evening Meeting. These active and passive methods are designed to help release stress and connect deeply with inner silence.

Facilities like the Basho Spa, Olympic-sized swimming pool, gym, and vegetarian dining areas add to the overall wellness-focused lifestyle. The campus is clean, well-managed, and attracts visitors from around the world, creating a global, open-minded community.

However, the resort does have strict entry protocols including HIV testing and required attire (maroon/white robes), and the costs can be relatively high.

pun096,pun096_r2,pooja deshmukh,1,"Marriage Function ‚Äì 26th April 2024

Extremely disappointing experience. We had high hopes, but the hotel failed on every front.

There was a power failure during the ceremony, and shockingly, even the generator didn‚Äôt work. The ACs were not functioning, causing severe discomfort. To add to the mess, the lift wasn‚Äôt working either, and there was no backup, forcing elderly guests to use the stairs.

Morning breakfast and tea counters weren‚Äôt set up on time, and starters were served cold and poorly managed.

We tried contacting the management, but no one was willing to help or even share a number. The entire day was stressful instead of joyous.

For a venue that claims to host weddings, the lack of planning, professionalism, and basic infrastructure was shocking. Avoid unless they make serious improvements.

The hotel is conveniently located on the Hinjewadi main road, very close to the NH 48, and also close to Phase 1 offices and well connected with Phase 2 and 3 as well; thus making it suitable for both business travelers and tourists traveling to and from Mumbai. It is also very near to D-Mart and XION mall which is a plus. Multiple restaurant options are available nearby. Rooms are big, spacious and cleaned regularly. Bathrooms are modern, clean, and sufficiently stacked with kits. But the room decor can do with more attention and the current style can be best described as a bit of drab! Overall look and feel also have opportunity for improvement. However, this shortfall is minor and is made up by the warmth of the hotel stuff and service quality. The management is also attentive. The breakfast buffet is good with multiple choices and typically being included in tariff helps. But ala carte is quite expensive and the overall food quality can be best described as okayish for the price they charge.

When I finally got the room, it was dirty and clearly not cleaned properly. The hygiene standards are unacceptable, and it's shocking that a hotel can operate like this.

I had chosen this place based on promises of good service, but sadly, those promises were completely false. I hope the management sees this and takes urgent steps to improve both staff behavior and cleanliness.

pun109,pun109_r2,popat ghanvat,1,"Disappointing Stay ‚Äì Not Worth the Price

I recently stayed at housemate , and unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. Despite the hotel‚Äôs appealing photos and promises, the reality was disappointing.

Cleanliness: The room was not properly cleaned. There were stains on the sheets, dust on surfaces, and the bathroom had an unpleasant odor. This is unacceptable for any hotel, let alone one that claims to provide a high-quality experience.

Service: The staff seemed indifferent and unhelpful. Check-in was slow, and despite raising several issues (such as the broken air conditioner and lack of towels), nothing was resolved. Basic hospitality and attentiveness were completely lacking.

Facilities: The amenities were poorly maintained. The pool looked dirty, and the gym equipment was outdated and barely functional. Wi-Fi was also slow and unreliable, making it difficult to stay connected.

Noise: The hotel was very noisy at night due to poor soundproofing. I could hear guests in adjacent rooms and loud music from the bar well past midnight. This made it nearly impossible to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.

Overall, I expected much more for the price I paid. Sadly, housemate did not meet even the most basic standards of comfort, cleanliness, and service. I would not recommend staying here unless major improvements are made.",2025-03-29T05:52:45.809402Z,5 months ago

The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, making it easy to access key landmarks like MG Road, Camp area, and the peaceful Sadhu Vaswani Mission ‚Äî which is just a short walk away.

The rooms at Hotel Ritz are spacious, clean, and well-maintained, offering all the basic amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The staff was courteous and professional, always ready to help with a smile. The check-in and check-out process was smooth and hassle-free.

One of the highlights of the hotel is its peaceful ambience, which complements the spiritual vibe of the nearby Sadhu Vaswani Mission. The in-house restaurant serves good quality food with several vegetarian options, which was especially appreciated after visiting the mission that promotes a pure vegetarian lifestyle.

Whether you're visiting Pune for spiritual reasons, business, or leisure, Hotel Ritz is a reliable and convenient place to stay. It offers a good balance of comfort, location, and value for money.

Would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to Pune.",2025-07-08T12:28:35.794012678Z,2 months ago

I mentioned it to a young fellow at the counter who seemed to be the owner/his son (maybe). He suggested me Paneer Lababdar. I asked him that is it non-spicy, because I don't want a spicy gravy. He said yes it is non-spicy. Trusting him I placed an order for it along with phulkas. The phulkas were small and they charged me 30 rs per phulka. This is still fine.
But when we tasted the gravy at home, it was terribly spicy. Had not expected this from Ritz restaurant at all. We couldn't eat the gravy at all.
This review is not a complaint, but just a request to the owner, to please look into this. Customers come with a lot of trust & liking for your restaurant & it's food. And when we experience something like this, it's disheartening.",2025-08-04T15:00:59.926112226Z,a month ago

pun135,pun135_r3,Ritzz,2,"I had a very disappointing experience at Jugglers & Backpack In Pune , and I feel it‚Äôs important to share this to help other travelers make an informed decision. Here's a breakdown of the issues I faced:

1. Poor Facilities & Comfort:

The bathroom is located outside the room, which is highly inconvenient, especially at night or during bad weather.& Geaser is also not working

The AC in the room barely works ‚Äî it felt like a fan on low speed, not cooling the room at all.

The ""Non AC bed"" experience was so uncomfortable, it honestly felt like being in a general train compartment ‚Äî cramped, noisy, and suffocating in ground leval.

2. Lack of Basic Amenities:

There's no proper sitting or common area to relax or meet other guests, which defeats the purpose of staying in a hostel.

No drinking water is provided ‚Äî you have to buy bottled water, which is unfair, especially in hot weather.

Water is kept in a common container, which felt unhygienic and unmonitored.

The only positive thing was that breakfast in the morning was good, but it doesn‚Äôt make up for the poor facilities overall.

Safety concerns.

There‚Äôs no medical kit or first-aid facility, and no fire safety equipment like a fire extinguisher or hydrant. This raises serious safety concerns.

3. Connectivity & Communication Issues:

Once inside the room, mobile network signals completely vanish, making it impossible to stay connected or even make a call.

The charging points were faulty ‚Äî one didn‚Äôt work at all, and the other was loose and the adapter kept falling out. Charging my phone became a struggle.

Luggage & Safety Concerns

There was no responsibility taken for luggage; you are on your own.

4.Misleading Images & False Expectations:-

The kitchen, rooftop, and sitting areas shown in the photos are not real or maintained as advertised.

The reality is far from the online presentation ‚Äî the kitchen was in bad condition, and there were no clean or usable seating areas anywhere.

At reception, there were a few old sofas, but not useful for relaxing

5. Overall Experience:

The place felt poorly maintained, uncomfortable, and unsafe.

The staff seemed careless, and there was no sense of hospitality or customer service.

For the price they charge, the hostel offers none of the comfort or convenience you‚Äôd expect ‚Äî not even the basics.

I Final Thoughts:

This was a very bad experience for me. The place is not what it appears in pictures, and basic needs like safety, comfort, connectivity, and cleanliness were not met. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone solo travelers, international tourists, or anyone expecting even a basic level of comfort and safety concerns.

- The owner is very welcoming and helpful.
- The bed is amazing in terms of size and comfort.

Bad:
- The entrance is very narrow with stairs so the suitcase needs to be carried. If the property hires someone solely for this service it would be beneficial for them.
- The duvet was horrible with dirt and marks all over and this is something that cannot be ignored.

Summary:
I chose this hotel because of the location as I had my flight the same evening. I couldn't use the duvet because of what it looked like. I couldn't sleep because of the constant banging sounds.

Same goes with the balcony. Also, they serve the breakfast at the Magnus Square hotel, which is about 20 metres away from Calypso Suites. The elevator is old-styled and needs efforts to close and open. Price wise, it is okay. Staff is professional. But they won't tell you the wifi details until you ask for the same.
