For such a reputed property, I was expecting more creativity, better flavors, and at least some signature dishes, but the food was bland and repetitive.\n\nOn the positive side, the ambience and service were decent, but ac was not working and when you go for a buffet, the food should be the highlight\u2014and here it clearly wasn\u2019t.

Whether it was a simple request like a Band-Aid or anything else, nothing came without repeated calls.\n\nOne evening it was raining heavily and no Ola/Uber was available. I was just 850 meters away and requested the hotel to help with a pickup. They refused, giving excuses, which was surprising for a brand like Hilton.\n\nDuring dining, the staff seemed more focused on reminding guests to pay the bill rather than offering a warm dining experience. At least four staff members came, one after the other, just to remind me to settle the bill. No one even asked how the food was.\n\nAt check-out, I politely asked if I could go back to the room for a quick change of clothes, or if they could provide a small space. The response was a blunt \u201cyou can use the restroom, no other place will be allowed.\u201d Not something you'd expect from a hospitality-first brand.\n\nWhile the property itself is well-maintained, the staff attitude and service levels need serious improvement.

            "text": "Food Quality and Service:\n\nThe overall quality of the food was subpar. Many attendees tasted the food but left their plates unfinished. Notably, chapatis were not served, and soup was unavailable. The excessive use of garlic in the dishes was also a common complaint among guests.\n\nThe food service appeared disorganized, giving the impression that it was complimentary rather than part of a paid event.\n\nService Staff Availability:\n\nThere was a noticeable lack of service staff attending to our VIP guests.

On August 12th, around 22:35, I dined at your evening buffet and was served Chicken Malai. Unfortunately, upon inspecting the dish, I found a hair in it. I immediately brought this to the attention of the Floor Chef and Duty Manager, who took the issue seriously and apologized for the inconvenience.\n\nThe Chef and Duty Manager offered to replace the dish, but given the nature of the issue, I decided not to continue with my meal. As a guest, it's unsettling to encounter such an incident, and it raises questions about the quality control measures in place.\n\nFurthermore, I had a similar experience the previous day when I requested your floor team to send some fresh dishes from the buffet to my room as I returned late from a site visit. To my surprise, I received leftover food from the buffet, which was not what I had requested. This incident not only raised concerns about food handling but also made me question whether the hotel was prioritizing cost savings over serving fresh food to guests.\n\nWhile I appreciate the prompt response from the Chef and Duty Manager regarding the hair incident, these experiences collectively raise concerns about the overall food safety and hygiene standards at your hotel. I understand that mistakes can happen, but I hope you'll take this feedback constructively and review your quality control processes to ensure the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.\n\nI hope that you will take my feedback seriously and take necessary actions to address these concerns.

The spa\u2019s management is very professional and gives a true sense of luxury. Definitely a must-visit if you want to pamper yourself",

Unfortunately, despite the room being vacant, we were made to wait two hours before being given the keys. I understand hotel policies may not allow early check-in more than four hours before standard time, but what was disappointing was that even during those two hours in the lobby, it took them an hour just to serve us a glass of water.\n\nThe suite itself is spacious, with two bathrooms, a sitting area, and a bedroom. However, I learned that the property is 15 years old, and it shows. The room has wooden paneling on all walls, but the storage space is limited\u2014just one cupboard, which is inadequate for even two people. The mattress was slightly smaller than the bed, affecting the aesthetics. The room had a musty smell, like it hadn\u2019t been aired out in a while. The bathroom is large with a bathtub, but the fittings, mirror, and toilet look old and in need of replacement. There was no hot water during my first day. The French windows in both the bedroom and sitting area have visible water stains, which affect the view. Outside the room, the passageway has water dripping from the roof, possibly from AC vents.\n\nI requested a room freshener to deal with the musty smell, but it never arrived. The reception staff were polite but not particularly warm\u2014everything was handled in a matter-of-fact way without much hospitality.\n\nOn the positive side, the location is excellent\u2014right in the Hazratganj area, close to all major tourist spots in Lucknow.

Located in the heart of Lucknow, the hotel combines traditional Indian hospitality with modern amenities, making it a preferred choice for both business and leisure travelers.\n\nHistorical Background\n\nOriginally opened in the mid-1990s, the hotel has undergone several transformations. It started as the Taj Residency before being rebranded as Vivanta, and finally, after a recent extensive renovation, it stands as the full-fledged Taj Mahal Hotel. This evolution reflects the hotel's commitment to maintaining high standards and adapting to the competitive landscape.\n\nRooms and Suites\n\nThe Taj Mahal Hotel, Lucknow, offers a range of accommodations, from standard rooms to opulent suites. Guests frequently highlight the impeccable cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. The suites, in particular, are noted for their spaciousness and luxurious touches. An upgrade to a suite often includes added perks such as complimentary meals and early check-in options, enhancing the overall guest experience.\n\nDining\n\nThe hotel boasts multiple dining options, each providing a unique culinary experience. The on-site restaurants serve a variety of cuisines, with particular praise for the quality of breakfast, lunch, and dinner offerings. Guests have singled out the morning flute music and the delicious jalebi as memorable aspects of their dining experience. In-room dining also receives high marks for its quality and convenience.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Taj Mahal Hotel, Lucknow, features a range of facilities designed to cater to the needs of its guests. The swimming pool and garden area provide a serene environment for relaxation and leisure. The hotel's gym, while functional, has received mixed reviews, with some guests noting issues with temperature control and equipment quality.\n\nService\n\nOne of the standout features of the Taj Mahal Hotel, Lucknow, is its exceptional service. Guests consistently praise the staff for their politeness, helpfulness, and attentiveness. From the reception to room service and luggage assistance, the staff\u2019s commitment to guest satisfaction is evident. Specific employees are often mentioned by name in reviews, highlighting the personalized service that guests appreciate.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nWhile the overall feedback is overwhelmingly positive, there are occasional criticisms. Some guests have pointed out issues with the room temperature, finding it difficult to adjust the thermostat to a comfortable level. Additionally, the gym facilities have been described as basic and not up to the standard expected from a luxury hotel.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Taj Mahal Hotel, Lucknow, stands out as one of the city\u2019s finest luxury hotels, offering a blend of traditional elegance and modern convenience. Its strengths lie in its high-quality service, luxurious accommodations, and excellent dining options. Although there are minor areas for improvement, particularly regarding the gym and room temperature control, the overall guest experience is highly positive.

The ambiance of the hotel lobby was elegant and inviting, setting the tone for a luxurious stay.\n\nMy room boasted stunning views of the city skyline and the molecular view, creating a captivating backdrop for my stay. Additionally, I enjoyed live music from my room, adding a delightful touch to the experience. The spaciousness and modern design of the room were particularly impressive, providing a comfortable and stylish retreat.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was spending time at the hotel's breathtaking swimming pool located on the top floor. The panoramic views combined with the serene atmosphere created a truly unforgettable experience. Whether taking a refreshing dip or simply lounging by the poolside, it was the perfect way to unwind after a busy day of exploring the city.\n\nIn addition to the outstanding facilities, the dining options at the hotel were also exceptional. From sumptuous breakfast spreads to gourmet dinners, the culinary offerings catered to every palate and exceeded all expectations.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Lucknow was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, stunning amenities, and the captivating top-floor swimming pool made it a truly memorable experience. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a five-star stay in the heart of Lucknow.",

The room was also clean and well-maintained, with fresh towels and toiletries provided daily.\n\nThe hotel's amenities were top-notch, including a well-equipped gym, an outdoor pool, and a restaurant serving a variety of cuisines.
