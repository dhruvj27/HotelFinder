It\u2019s located close to Aga Khan Palace, not too far from the airport or Phoenix Mall, which makes it convenient for work or quick errands. This is an older property compared to the newer Hyatt Pune Residences nearby, and that shows in the interiors. The rooms are spacious, but the dark wood d\u00e9cor makes them feel smaller and almost crampped. Still, they\u2019re well equipped with a study table, high back chairs and footstool, wardrobe, and a clean bathroom unit with shower and sink.\n\nThe pool area is nicely done and located next to their spa and salon. The salon is run by Arya, and I\u2019ve used it during work trips it\u2019s great to have those services available when you\u2019re short on time and need something basic for hair or skincare. They also have a Blue Tokai coffee counter in the lobby, which is a plus if you like good coffee and are coming from cities like Bangalore.\n\nThe food, however, is something I feel doesn\u2019t quite match up to five-star standards, not just at Hyatt but across many luxury hotels in Pune. That said, the Asian restaurant has a pleasant vibe\u2014especially at night when the water wall is lit up\u2014and the food is decent. One small touch I appreciated was at breakfast, where they placed a tiny glass bowl with a single fish on tables where people were dining alone. It was thoughtful and not something you see often.\n\nStaff is courteous and helpful. Check-in was smooth, and they were proactive in helping with things like flower arrangements when we needed them. Overall, it\u2019s a good property, especially for work trips, with a few thoughtful touches that stand out.",

The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful amenities. I especially liked how the power outlets were conveniently placed and adaptable to international standards, which made things much easier as a traveler. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which is always a welcome detail after a long day.\n\nThe hotel is also very conveniently located, making it a great choice for both business and leisure.

A big shoutout to Subhojeet and Pranali from the front office who went above and beyond to assist us. Despite a bit of a mix-up with the reservations team, they handled everything smoothly \u2014 arranging a smoking room for us and even extending our checkout time without any extra cost. It was such a relief and really made our stay more comfortable.\n\nA special mention to the Front Office Manager (FOM) who ensured we got the best possible tariff, allowing us to enjoy a luxurious suite room which they usually don\u2019t sale on OTAs. Their flexibility and understanding truly stood out.\n\nThe housekeeping team, especially Chetan and Tushar, were amazing as well. The room decoration was done beautifully and right on time, and they maintained cleanliness throughout our stay with a friendly and professional attitude.\n\nLastly, a big thank you to Tejas from the F&B team, who ensured our in-room dining experience was seamless and prompt. Every order was served with care and attention to detail.\n\nOverall,bit ups and down but this stay was one of the best we\u2019ve had in Pune after a long time where they have bathtubs in all the guest rooms, and it\u2019s all thanks to the wonderful team at Royal Orchid Central. We felt genuinely cared for, and we can\u2019t wait to return!\n\nHighly recommended!",

The room service was quick.\n3. They allow outside food. (Many hotels with this price range don't.)\n4. The staff behaviour was very cordial.\nI booked this hotel at a very discounted price @ \u20b93.6k.(including breakfast) Thats why i am giving 4 star. It does not worth more than 4k.

To top it off, they have warnings everywhere about a \u20b95,000 penalty if you smoke. Felt more like a restriction than hospitality.\n\n7. Room service \u2013 To be fair, this was the only saving grace.

Celebrating our anniversary, we were simply looking for a relaxing staycation to unwind and enjoy each other's company.\n\nFor the most part, our experience was indeed lovely. The hotel undeniably possesses the hallmarks of a five-star establishment. The food and drinks were a definite highlight, and we particularly enjoyed the extensive breakfast buffet. However, if you're planning a longer stay like ours, be aware that the buffet options might become a tad repetitive. The hotel also boasts excellent amenities, including a spa that we thoroughly enjoyed. Our balcony room was comfortable, featuring an exceptionally comfortable bed and prompt service whenever we requested it. The staff across the hotel were consistently polite and courteous.\n\nHowever, our stay was unfortunately punctuated by a series of unexpected hiccups that left us somewhat surprised, especially given the hotel's reputation. On one occasion, I was quite taken aback to find a piece of glass in my food during the breakfast buffet. While the staff were quick to apologize and address the situation, it was certainly a concerning incident.\n\nMy wife's experience with the salon was also disappointing. Despite enquiring a day in advance about curly hair products for a hair spa, the salon was unable to accommodate her needs. Furthermore, one day our room was missed during the cleaning service, even after we had specifically requested it. On our final night, we requested room service to clean our room upon our return, only to find that while the bed was tidied, the rubbish, trays, and the balcony remained untouched.\n\nSpeaking of the balcony, while it was a nice addition to our room, it ultimately felt underwhelming. Furnished with just a simple table and chairs and offering no shade from the intense daytime sun, it was unusable during the day. In the evenings, the abundance of mosquitos made it equally uninviting. The view from our room was also just satisfactory, with nearby buildings obstructing the sunrise.\n\nDespite these issues, I must acknowledge the hotel's commendable service recovery efforts. The staff consistently apologized for each incident and genuinely tried their best to rectify the situations. This proactive approach to service was definitely appreciated.\n\nUltimately, our anniversary staycation at The Westin Koregaon Park was a blend of positive and negative experiences. While the hotel offers many of the luxuries and services one expects from a five-star establishment, the series of unfortunate incidents we encountered during our short stay was surprising. It leaves us questioning whether it was simply bad luck or if there are underlying inconsistencies. While we appreciated the good aspects like the food, the comfortable room, and the polite staff, and especially their attempts to make things right, the repeated issues did detract from the seamless and relaxing experience we had hoped for. The salon, in particular, could benefit from better-trained staff who are knowledgeable about all the services offered.",

The ambiance was elegant and comfortable, providing a perfect setting for a relaxed team gathering.\n\nWe opted for the buffet lunch, which had a good spread of dishes. The food was delicious and well-presented, and everyone appreciated the variety available in the main course and desserts.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of areas for improvement. The vegetarian starter options were limited, and we would have appreciated a bit more variety for our vegetarian team members. Also, the refilling time for a few dishes was slightly slow, which caused a bit of a wait during peak lunch hour.\n\nThat said, the staff was courteous and responsive, and we enjoyed the overall experience. With a few small tweaks, it could be even better. Would still recommend for team lunches and group outings.",

The ambiance was elegant and comfortable, providing a perfect setting for a relaxed team gathering.\n\nWe opted for the buffet lunch, which had a good spread of dishes. The food was delicious and well-presented, and everyone appreciated the variety available in the main course and desserts.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of areas for improvement. The vegetarian starter options were limited, and we would have appreciated a bit more variety for our vegetarian team members. Also, the refilling time for a few dishes was slightly slow, which caused a bit of a wait during peak lunch hour.\n\nThat said, the staff was courteous and responsive, and we enjoyed the overall experience. With a few small tweaks, it could be even better. Would still recommend for team lunches and group outings.",

            "text": "Title: Disappointing Experience at JW Marriott Pune\n\nI recently had the opportunity to stay at JW Marriott Pune, and unfortunately, it was one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had in a hotel. As someone who has stayed in numerous luxury accommodations around the world and experienced the best of hospitality, I was shocked by the subpar level of service provided at this establishment.\n\nFirstly, the quality of the food was far from satisfactory. The dal, vegetable curries, and other dishes were served cold, which was extremely disappointing. Additionally, the wait time for ordering was excessively long, making the dining experience frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nMoreover, the lack of coordination among the staff was evident throughout my visit. For instance, when my family and I arrived for lunch, we were informed that the buffet would be available until 3:30 PM. However, to our dismay, it closed earlier than promised, preventing us from enjoying a meal. Despite this inconvenience, we were still charged for the full buffet, which seemed unfair and insensitive.\n\nAnother area of concern was the room service. Numerous attempts to reach them went unanswered, leaving us feeling ignored and neglected. The unprofessional behavior exhibited by the staff further exacerbated our frustration. Their indifference and lack of care gave the impression that they did not value their guests.\n\nGiven my experience, I would strongly advise against wasting your money on a hotel that fails to meet even the basic standards of hospitality. The JW Marriott Pune left a lot to be desired, and I regret choosing it for my stay. I sincerely hope that the management takes note of these issues and makes the necessary improvements to ensure a more pleasant experience for future guests.",

The service was impeccable, and the staff's dedication to making our visit comfortable was evident from the start.\nThe hotel's culinary team expertly catered to all my dietary restrictions, providing not just safe, but also incredibly delicious food. I was especially impressed with the tremendous improvement in the bakery section.\nA huge thank you to Aniket in room service, along with Ashish, Kundan, Sandipan, Jh, and Pratik, for their friendly and helpful service. They even packed us a lunch and organized a small \"Bon Voyage\" session, which was a very thoughtful touch.\nI highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Pune.

My recent stay there was nothing short of spectacular, marked by the seamless blend of luxury, culinary excellence, and exceptional service. The spacious rooms welcomed me with breathtaking views of the city skyline, creating a tranquil retreat away from the hustle and bustle below. Every corner of the room was thoughtfully designed, from the plush bedding to the modern amenities, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.\n\nThe experience began with the incredibly efficient front office team, whose professionalism and warm approach made check-in a breeze. My dining journey kicked off at Mosaic, a multi-cuisine outlet that truly lives up to its reputation. From Asian delicacies to classic European dishes and Indian favorites, every meal was a delightful explosion of flavors. The skilled chefs clearly know their craft, presenting each dish with finesse and a touch of creativity that made dining at Mosaic feel like a global culinary tour.\n\nEvviva Sky Lounge, perched high above the city, quickly became my favorite spot. The panoramic views combined with the latest music set the perfect backdrop for a relaxing evening. The bar staff were nothing short of magicians, crafting cocktails that were as visually stunning as they were delicious. The atmosphere was vibrant, yet intimate\u2014a rare balance that made Evviva feel like a hidden gem in the sky.\n\nThe food and beverage service team consistently impressed me with their attentiveness and deep knowledge of the menu, elevating the dining experience at every turn. It was clear that service excellence is a core value at Crowne Plaza, and it shines through in every interaction.\n\nI also had the opportunity to explore the hotel\u2019s banqueting facilities, which were elegantly designed and equipped to handle everything from intimate gatherings to large celebrations. The level of detail put into each event space reflected the hotel\u2019s commitment to quality, making it an ideal choice for any occasion.\n\nFor a bit of relaxation, the spa offered a much-needed escape. The therapists guided me through a rejuvenating experience that left me feeling refreshed and recharged. It\u2019s an oasis within the hotel, providing a perfect balance of tranquility and luxury. The fitness room, adjacent to the spa, was well-equipped and provided the perfect setting for a quick workout, allowing me to keep up with my fitness routine effortlessly.\n\nNavigating the hotel was made even smoother thanks to the quick and efficient valet and security staff, who were always on hand to assist with a level of service that was both courteous and professional.\n\nCrowne Plaza Pune is more than just a hotel\u2014it\u2019s a complete experience that caters to every need with style and grace. From the enchanting views and luxurious rooms to the top-notch dining and impeccable service, every aspect of my stay was thoughtfully curated, making it a place I\u2019ll eagerly return to whenever I\u2019m in Pune.\n\nThanks to the entire team. From expert and experienced GM to normal Bus Boy working for Crowne, each and everyone is there to make your visit unforgettable.\n\nManav Kaushik",

The staffs are friendly and great hospitality. The room are neat and clean. The best part is mineral waters are provided free of charge EVERYDAY -> 2 in bathroom, 2 on table, 2 on each side of the bed, total 8 bottles per day. We bought extra 3 big mineral bottles from phoenix mall, apparently there is no need to buy since the hotel\u2019s mineral waters are sufficient for each day usage. You can request to check out latest by 2pm, it is chargeable after that. I hope that the hotel continue to maintain the standard. Hope this help!",
