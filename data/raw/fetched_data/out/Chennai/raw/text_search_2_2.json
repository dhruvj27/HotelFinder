The food service was exceptional, with staff being incredibly attentive and friendly throughout my visit especially Chef Bhawani, her explanation was quiet polite. The breakfast buffet was a highlight, offering a fantastic variety of dishes that catered to every taste. From fresh fruit and pastries to hot breakfast options, there was something for everyone! The modern yet cozy decor created a warm and welcoming atmosphere. It was the perfect setting to start the day off right. I highly recommend Rain Tree Hotel for anyone looking for great food, outstanding service, and a comfortable, stylish place to stay. Will definitely be coming back!",

Please read completely before going!\n\nI visited Citrus Caf\u00e9 at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram with my fianc\u00e9e, expecting at least basic professionalism for the money they charge. Instead, it turned out to be the worst dining experience I\u2019ve ever had. A complete waste of time and patience.\n\nI ordered a Greek salad, clearly written in the menu with feta cheese. What arrived after one hour was a bowl of chunky, oversized vegetable pieces drowned in lemon juice, with paneer thrown on top instead of feta. No oregano, no olive oil , basically, it wasn\u2019t a Greek salad at all. The staff never bothered to tell us they didn\u2019t have feta. I had to ask the waitress why there was paneer, only for her to casually say, \u201cWe don\u2019t have feta, sir.\u201d No apology, no heads-up, nothing.\n\nThe basics are missing here. I asked for grilled peri peri chicken skewers with minimal oil and made it extremely clear that my medical condition doesn\u2019t permit me to eat oily food. What came out of the kitchen was deep fried, not grilled. So their \u201cgrilled\u201d skewers are a lie too. The staff just shrugged and said sorry. When I asked for the manager, nobody showed up. The kitchen staff came instead and claimed the manager was \u201cbusy\u201d.\n\nI also ordered two lime sodas. They never arrived. After wasting an entire hour waiting for just a salad and a wrongly cooked chicken, I told them I\u2019d pay for the pathetic salad and leave. They refused to even let me pay, acting guilty, but what\u2019s the point? Basic courtesy and competence are missing here.\n\nThis place claims to have a decent a la carte menu. The reality is they don\u2019t have half the ingredients, they don\u2019t tell you upfront, and they have zero training to handle basic customer requests.\n\nIf you value your time, money, tastebuds, and basic respect, do not step inside Citrus Caf\u00e9 at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram. It\u2019s run by incompetent staff, clueless chefs, and a manager who hides when there\u2019s a problem. For a brand like Lemon Tree, this level of service is embarrassing.\n\nNever going back. Strongly NOT recommended.",

What was supposed to be a simple, hassle-free experience turned into an absolute nightmare due to gross negligence and misleading assurances.\n\nDespite booking this hotel specifically because of the promised parking availability, I was shocked to find there were no usable parking slots on-site. Instead, I was instructed to leave my car outside the hotel premises \u2014 an area completely infested with pigeon droppings. It's clear this is a long-standing issue that the management has willfully ignored.\n\nAs a direct result of this, my vehicle suffered severe paint damage, with the outer layer peeling off due to the acidic contamination. The repair costs are estimated at INR 20,000, which is almost seven times what I paid for my stay. This is completely unacceptable and reflects a total disregard for guest property and satisfaction.\n\nTo say I am disappointed would be an understatement. This experience was not just inconvenient \u2014 it was financially damaging and deeply frustrating. I would strongly advise others to think twice before trusting the claims made by this establishment.\n\nAvoid at all costs unless you're ready to pay a heavy price \u2014 quite literally \u2014 for your stay.",

Most of the taps and faucets hardly have any water coming through.\nOne major problem with this hotel is the parking. If you are not diligent about collecting the parking coupon and handing it at the mall parking exit, money will be automatically debited from your Fastag and the hotel takes no responsibility for it. We were unaware of this the first time, nor did the hotel inform us. So more than \u20b9800 got deducted from our Fastag and the hotel refused to provide any sort of compensation. Too disappointing.\nAnother thing to be mindful of is your ID proofs after check-in. The staff tends to forget to return them, and we noticed they had a huge stack of unclaimed IDs. So, be sure to collect yours before heading to your room.\nComing to the good part, the breakfast at Annam Cafe is great. Rooms have all the amenities. The hotel is designed in a unique and interesting fashion - truly a \u201cDesign Hotel\u201d, lol.\nOverall, not recommended for a stay anymore as the tariff is quite high for the current quality and maintenance.",

The third floor is where the cafe is and due to lack of ventilation in the passageway, there was a strong stench from the kitchen in the passageway (I dont think this is a cause of concern and it is just particular to my stay)\nThe reason I am giving 3.5/5 stars is because of the location with direct lift to the mall through Purple Chameleon restaurant, the discount you can get at this restaurant if you stay at the hotel and the courteous staff who prepared us breakfast before 7 AM (breakfast buffet starts at 7:30 AM ).\nIts 25 minutes from the airport with moderate traffic and is a pleasant stay.

We were unsure of how things would be managed, but what happened next genuinely moved us.\n\nMr. Kartick, who looked after us during our stay, was nothing short of a blessing. From the very beginning, he noticed the specific needs of my parents and took it upon himself to ensure they were comfortable and well taken care of. He didn\u2019t just do his duty\u2014he went above and beyond, often checking in personally, remembering their preferences, and serving food that was not only suitable for their health but also brought them a sense of home and comfort.\n\nIt felt like he wasn\u2019t just serving guests\u2014he was serving with care, empathy, and a big heart. Watching my parents enjoy their meals without worry, feeling relaxed and nurtured, meant the world to me. It\u2019s not something we experience often, and I\u2019ll always carry that with me.\n\nTo Mr. Kartick and the team at Park Sabari\u2014thank you for not just providing service, but for offering genuine kindness.

I want to especially mention Bivek and Anamika, who went out of their way to take excellent care of us. Their friendly attitude, professionalism, and genuine care really stood out. They made sure every meal was comfortable, delicious, and enjoyable, taking personal interest in our preferences and ensuring everything was perfect.\n\nThe rooms were clean, spacious, and well-maintained, and the overall ambiance of the hotel was calm and welcoming.

I always commend the spacious rooms, excellent amenities, and the hospitality of your staff. However, I\u2019d like to bring to your attention a recurring concern regarding air conditioning.\n\nOn multiple occasions, I\u2019ve noticed that the AC in the rooms is not cooling efficiently. While the team has been responsive in offering room changes, I believe a long-term solution would enhance the overall guest experience. Additionally, I\u2019ve also felt that the cooling in the lobby could be improved to make it more comfortable. While sales and targets are crucial, guest experience plays an equally important role in long-term success.\n\nRegarding the reception staff, I\u2019ve seen some reviews about a particular female staff member being perceived as rude. However, from my personal experience, she has always been professional and efficient during my check-ins and check-outs. I do feel that if she isn\u2019t smiling at times, it may simply mean something is off that day, rather than a reflection of her attitude. If she happens to read this, I just want to say she\u2019s doing a great job, and I\u2019d love to see a smile on her face!\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider this feedback. I truly appreciate the effort your team puts in and look forward to an even better stay next time.",

            "text": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Taj Vivanta Chennai for a delightful five-day work trip. From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel, I was greeted with warm hospitality and impeccable service. The hotel boasts a range of excellent amenities, including free access to the gym and swimming pool, making it an ideal choice for those seeking relaxation and wellness.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the spaciousness and comfort of the rooms. The king-size beds provided a luxurious and restful sleep experience, ensuring that I woke up refreshed and ready to take on the day's adventures. The attention to detail in the room's design and furnishings was impressive, and I felt like every aspect was carefully curated to provide maximum comfort.\n\nOne standout feature of Taj Vivanta Chennai is the complimentary laundry service. They provided one pair of laundry free per day, which was incredibly convenient, especially for longer stays. This thoughtful gesture saved me the hassle of finding a laundromat or spending extra money on laundry services.\n\nWhen it comes to dining, Taj Vivanta Chennai exceeded my expectations. The food served was consistently delicious, and the variety of options ensured that there was something to suit every palate. The culinary team showcased their expertise in both local and international cuisines, offering a delightful fusion of flavors. I particularly enjoyed the attentive and friendly service provided by the staff in the restaurants, making each dining experience memorable.\n\nIn terms of location, Taj Vivanta Chennai is situated approximately 30 kilometers away from the Chennai central railway station. While this may be a bit far for some travelers, the hotel's convenient location allows easy access to the city's attractions and landmarks. Getting to the hotel from the railway station is hassle-free, as cabs are readily available, providing a comfortable and quick journey.\n\nOverall, my stay at Taj Vivanta Chennai was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of luxurious amenities, comfortable accommodations, delectable dining options, and attentive service made my experience truly memorable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chennai, whether for business or leisure, as it offers a perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and hospitality.",

Whether it was the front desk staff accommodating my requests with a smile or the housekeeping team maintaining impeccable cleanliness, every interaction was marked by a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.\nI failed to ask the name of the person who accommodated us but he was very sweet. A person with specs.\nOne aspect that truly stood out was the attention to detail.

Mr Ashlin is a well mannered and very helpful employee of the hotel and the way he interacts with guests is truly amazing. I\u2019m truly glad Raintree has Ashlin working for them.\nMoreover, the dining options were outstanding.

Kusum, preethy and Bapan were exceptional and I was surprised to see how caring and how well the senior staff were supporting their juniors by helping them clear the plates and handling guests. Not everywhere we get to see Senior managers help their junior staff to this extent\nOverall, my stay at The Raintree St Mary\u2019s Road  was nothing short of outstanding.

From check-in to check-out, the hospitality stood out, making my stay both comfortable and convenient.\n\nThe location is ideal for business travelers, especially those with meetings along the OMR corridor. It\u2019s well-connected and easy to access from major IT hubs and offices. Despite being on a busy stretch, the hotel maintains a quiet, calm atmosphere inside.\n\nRooms were modern, clean, and well-maintained, with all the essential amenities\u2014comfortable beds, crisp linens, a well-stocked minibar, and a clean bathroom. Housekeeping was prompt and did a great job every day. The Wi-Fi speed was reliable, which made working from the room seamless.\n\nThe restaurant served a good variety of dishes across cuisines, including some authentic South Indian options. The breakfast buffet was especially noteworthy with its range and freshness. Room service was also timely, and the food arrived warm and well-packed.\n\nThe staff at the front desk, housekeeping, and restaurant were courteous, professional, and always ready to help. I had a minor issue with the in-room AC, and the team responded quickly to fix it, which I appreciated.\n\nFacilities like the gym and banquet halls seemed well-equipped and clean, though I didn\u2019t have time to use them personally. There\u2019s ample parking as well.\n\nIf I were to suggest an area for improvement, it would be to enhance soundproofing between rooms. I occasionally heard hallway noise.\n\nOverall, a solid 4-star property that delivers on expectations. Whether you\u2019re traveling for business or leisure, Regenta Central RS is a reliable choice in Chennai OMR. I would happily consider staying here again.",

We really loved the infrastructure and interiors of the hotel. We had our College Freshers Party in the 'Volvo Hall' last week which was pretty big and amazing for a party and business meetings.

From check-in to checkout, the experience was warm, welcoming, and highly satisfying.\n\n\ud83d\udecf\ufe0f Room & Amenities:\n\nThe room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and thoughtfully arranged.\n\nThe beds were plush and comfortable, and the room came with a study desk and a detailed booklet that included hotel policies, room service menu, and useful guest info.\n\nThere was a refreshment station with tea, coffee, milk powder, sugar sachets, and an electric kettle.\n\nA mini fridge was also available, perfect for storing cold drinks or snacks.\n\nThere were windows, though our view was blocked by a nearby apartment\u2014so we kept them closed.

It was rich, diverse, and freshly prepared every day, catering to both South Indian and North Indian tastes.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what we enjoyed:\n\nSouth Indian classics: Idli, Pongal, Upma, Poori, Vada, Sambar, and Chutneys.\n\nRotational items like Rava Pongal, Idiyappam, and special curries were included on alternate days.\n\nLive counters for Dosa varieties and Omelette options were a big hit.\n\nBread with toaster, salads, and continental-style veggies like baked potatoes, sweet corn, baby corn, and banana.\n\nFresh fruits \u2013 Pineapple, Papaya, Watermelon \u2013 always chilled and juicy.\n\nSausages and warm curries complemented the spread.\n\nWelcome drinks like Lychee, Watermelon, and Strawberry juices gave a refreshing start during breakfast.\n\nAnd I must mention \u2013 their tea and coffee were blended beautifully with milk.

Their warmth was one of the reasons we extended our stay by an extra day \u2013 even though we had originally booked for just 2 nights.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Location Benefits:\n\nThe hotel\u2019s location in Sholinganallur made it easy for us to explore places on the ECR stretch:\n\nVGP Marine Kingdom\nECR Beach\nMayajaal\nVandalur Zoo\nPhoenix MarketCity\n\nAll of these were easily accessible with short travel times.\n\n---\n\n\u2b50 Final Verdict:\n\nHotel Halez in Sholinganallur gave us the perfect combination of comfort, service, and location.\nWould definitely recommend for both families and business travelers. If you're looking for a clean, well-maintained hotel with great food and thoughtful hospitality in Chennai, this should be high on your list.",
