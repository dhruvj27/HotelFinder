The breakfast spread was also very nice. The stay was good and the restaurants seemed nice and the restaurant staff were very welcoming.\n\nThe check-in/front desk however, was not good.\nWe explicitly asked for 2 key cards and they gave us just one. A lady at the reception brushed me off quite rudely and insisted that she gave me 2 keycards. I had to get her boss involved and she was too arrogant to even acknowledge her mistake.\n\nAt check-out, I got my change in cash and another lady (different one from check-in) at the reception was quite condescending for some reason and decided by herself to shortchange me by 64 Rs. Its not a big amount, and I would have been fine with it, if she had only asked me first. It doesn't matter if its 1 rupee as well, it is only common courtesy to ask my permission first.\n\nOverall, the hotel itself is nice but the reception staff damaged my experience a lot.\n\nEdit (Aug/20): We reached out to the person who commented below on Aug/11 and there has been no reply yet. Just proves the point that the service here is terrible.\nThat decides it, never staying here again and would not recommend it to anyone either.",

Breakfast was equally chaotic. All we asked for was a takeaway, only to be brushed off by a staff member who pointed us to another counter while standing in front of a whole stack himself.\n\nAt checkout, Laqshay didn\u2019t bother to ask about our stay or invite feedback perhaps because they already know how poor the experience is. all we got was a flat, meaningless \u201csorry.\u201d\n\nOverall, this stay was charmless, careless, and a complete waste of time.

Pool/gym staff were helpful and polite. The gym was a little small with not much room to use a mat but I just took a couple of mats outside to do some stretching/yoga.

            "text": "recently stayed at JW Marriott in Bengaluru for a week with my leadership team for a business conference. While my overall stay and hospitality was warm and welcoming, there were some surprising lapses in service that I wouldn\u2019t have expected from a brand of this caliber!!!\n\nThe highlights? The little touches that made me feel at home. Payal from JW Kitchen greeted me every morning with a warm smile and recognized my room number by my face. Athili, the lovely housekeeper, did a fresh flower d\u00e9cor on my bed each day and created the most soothing turndown tub service after long workdays. Dinesh from the concierge went above and beyond by bringing me medication when I wasn\u2019t feeling well - even though I had only requested for a cup of cumin seeds. The AYS team was consistently responsive and polite. Laasya from Guest Relations made my day with a sweet JW note and treat for being a Bonvoy member. Sakthi from the wellness center took care of us with genuine kindness during facility maintenance. And Abhishek from housekeeping was always warm and engaging in our interactions!!\n\nOther favorites from my stay included the fantastic breakfast spread, the well-equipped wellness center, pool, and gym, and the beautiful view of Cubbon Park from my room\u2019s balcony. The smiling restaurant staff, who patiently served me without a single frown, truly elevated my experience, and I really appreciate each and everyone from the F&Brb team! They did a fabulous job!!!!\n\nHowever, there were some aspects that fell short. One day, I returned to my room and found a small dead roach inside a paper bag of breakfast bread I had packed and accidentally left behind. While I can\u2019t say for sure whether it came from the kitchen or the room, it was alarming. Housekeeping was inconsistent with some basic stuffs like one of the trash bins left uncleared, the kettle not cleaned for nearly five days, and essentials like water bottles and glasses were sometimes not restocked. I ignored these, thinking they were one-time misses, but it began to feel like a recurring pattern. At breakfast one day, my simple request for a one-egg cheese masala omelette with chicken sausages got messed up - twice!!!\n\nOne particularly disappointing experience was when I arranged a surprise room decoration for the son of our company\u2019s COO (who was also staying there). I had clearly asked the GRM, Sanchita, to inform me once the guests had stepped out before starting the decoration - but she didn\u2019t. The surprise was mishandled. Karan, the RDM, made a kind gesture to redo the setup in another room and added our gift, which I truly appreciated. However, neither he nor the original GRM followed up with me or met me afterward. Sanchita, in particular, didn\u2019t acknowledge the oversight or offer a sincere apology, and I truly feel that she doesn't have the eye for detail that a GRM should have!!\n\nDespite all this, I want to highlight that many team members were truly exceptional - their warmth, smiles, and willingness to go the extra mile made parts of my stay genuinely memorable. But at a JW Marriott, I do expect the basics to be non-negotiable: clean and well-serviced rooms, consistent housekeeping, and accurate attention to guest requests. That\u2019s what defines luxury!!\n\nI hope this feedback helps the team improve and better align guest experiences with the high standards JW is known for!\n\nWould I return? Possibly yes - or maybe not!!! Only time can tell that!!",

Despite booking for two occupants, the room felt barely adequate for one, let alone two adults and a child. The \"bed,\" if one could call it that, was laughably small \u2013 it seemed designed for a single person, making our stay incredibly uncomfortable and frustratingly restrictive for a family. Sleeping was a constant struggle, with little to no space for movement.Beyond the inadequate room, the noise levels were utterly unacceptable. Throughout the day, our stay was plagued by the incessant sounds of carpentry work emanating from within the hotel. This constant hammering, drilling, and sawing made it impossible to relax, work, or even have a quiet conversation. It completely disrupted any semblance of peace we hoped to find, turning the hotel into a construction zone rather than a place of rest.The combination of the claustrophobic room, the unbearable noise pollution, and the impractical bed size made our experience genuinely regrettable. What should have been a comfortable stay turned into a persistent source of irritation and discomfort. I would strongly advise against booking this hotel, especially if you are travelling with more than one person or a child, or if you value peace and quiet during your stay.",

The alchemy restaurant has a beautiful view of the city and although I don\u2019t drink, it does seem like a treat for people who like a fresh pint of beer and it\u2019s very possible because of their own microbrewery.

I understand you can't get scenic views in a city however this balcony served me no purpose except for drying my socks. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a good night's sleep so 5/5 on that. The bathroom had a tub which was a plus point.

The hotel\u2019s d\u00e9cor was exquisite, and the ambiance felt truly luxurious.\n\nOur room was stunning, offering breathtaking views of the airport and the thrill of watching flights take off. The thoughtful welcome gifts and goodies were a delightful touch. The food was simply divine\u2014the buffet spread was extensive, catering generously to both vegetarian and non-vegetarian preferences.\n\nWe also made time to relax by the pool and enjoyed some wonderful live music performances during our stay. A stroll through the lush green gardens in Bangalore\u2019s soothing weather was the perfect way to unwind.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Taj Bangalore for families seeking a luxurious and heartwarming experience. I\u2019m already looking forward to returning soon!",

This was my first experience where the kitchen team was available 24/7 to prepare food specially for kids. No matter what you request for your child, they make it with care. The food quality was also outstanding. A big thumbs up to the kitchen and service teams!\n\nI would also like to mention the security staff \u2014 especially Gopal ji, Nandu, Sachin, and Police Rao.

Given the brand\u2019s reputation and the premium price I paid for my stay, I expected a seamless and professional experience. Unfortunately, from the moment I arrived, I was met with inefficiencies and poor customer service.\n\nThe onboarding process was frustrating, as their online portal was not functioning properly, leading to unnecessary delays in the registration process. Additionally, as an Australian citizen with an Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI), I am exempt from the Form C requirement, which applies only to non-OCI holders. However, the manager and staff were completely unaware of this. I had to spend 10 minutes explaining Indian immigration policies to them as they insisted on seeing an entry stamp in my passport\u2014something that was neither required nor relevant.\n\nTo add to the inconvenience, just 15 minutes after checking in, hotel management knocked on my door asking for my passport again to make another copy. This was disruptive, unprofessional, and further highlighted the lack of coordination among the staff.\n\nOn top of all this, there was ongoing construction within the premises, right next to the dining area and restrooms. The dust and noise levels were unbearable, making the environment extremely uncomfortable. For a hotel of this stature, such conditions are unacceptable.\n\nWithin the first few minutes of my arrival, I was already regretting my choice. Lemon Tree needs to significantly improve its staff training, guest onboarding process, and overall service standards. I expected much better and hope they take this feedback seriously.",

The check-in process was seamless, and the staff made sure every request was handled with care. The room was elegantly designed, with plush bedding, modern amenities, and a breathtaking view of the city skyline. It was the perfect blend of comfort and sophistication.\n\nThe dining options were exceptional. The breakfast spread at CUR8 was diverse and delicious, featuring fresh, high-quality ingredients. I also had the chance to dine at Far & East, which offered an exquisite selection of Asian delicacies with impeccable presentation.\n\nThe pool and spa facilities added to the relaxation factor. The infinity pool was serene, and the spa treatments were rejuvenating, making it an ideal retreat after a long day.\n\nThe only minor drawback was that service at peak hours, especially in the restaurants, could be a tad slow. However, the staff\u2019s professionalism and courteous nature made up for it.\n\nOverall, Four Seasons Bangalore is an outstanding choice for a luxurious stay in the city.

They have a stunning lobby with glass doors and windows which is where I spent most of my time sitting on the couches reading the newspaper, working on my laptop or browsing on my phone.\n-The breakfast buffet was delicious. Lots of variety and food was tasty. The breakfast team treats you with respect and makes you feel like you're at home.\n-The night manager, Sairam, was a pleasure to speak with. He was friendly, courteous, professional and shared good tips for someone who isn't familiar with the city.\n-The rooms were clean and spacious and most importantly, they have an ethernet port. This was crucial for me as I would work during the weekday and I needed a strong and consistent internet connection to make video calls. Having the ethernet port made working easier.\n\nCons:\n- The wifi policy was silly. The policy was each room is only allowed 2 connections for the wifi and if you needed additional connections then they would provide you with a 24 hour connection (With data transfer constraints). So since I was staying with another guest and we each had 2 phones and 2 laptops, I would constantly ask for multiple 24 hour passwords almost every day. I asked for the hotel to make an exception but they said unfortunately that's their policy and nothing could be done. On my last day, I spoke to Managing Partner Mr. Shakeer and mentioned my wifi issue and he said they do make exceptions. If that was the case, then it was poorly communicated to the staff as I asked multiple times if something could be done.\n- Their gym is very sad. I wouldn't even call it a gym but rather a \"Cardio Room\" so people don't have a misunderstanding of what to expect. This wasn't too much of a big deal because I was always out and about but it would have been nice to lift some free weights.\n- After a couple months of stay, I noticed that their was a clog being developed in my standing shower that caused water to drain very slow which caused temporary flooding.\n-Mr. Santoush, one of the managers at the hotel is the most introvert manager I have ever met. During my 2 months staying at the hotel, he never once said hello to me. He would just walk by and act like I wasn't there. Even on my last day, as I was speaking to Mr. Shakeer, he was literally right there and never said a word or even thanked me for my stay. One of the pillars in the hospitality and tourism industry is customer service and this was definitely missing from him.\n\nOverall, the cons are minor compared to the pros and I would stay at the hotel again if I came back.",
