luc001,luc001_r1,sushil kumar,1,"Not Worth the Price ‚Äì Disappointed by Service Despite Good Rooms

I stayed recently at Hilton Garden Inn, Lucknow, and while the cleanliness and room quality were quite good, these basics are expected at any decent hotel‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre paying premium rates for a 4-5 star property.

Unfortunately, the overall service was disappointing:

Room service was very poor. Whether it was a simple request like a Band-Aid or anything else, nothing came without repeated calls.

One evening it was raining heavily and no Ola/Uber was available. I was just 850 meters away and requested the hotel to help with a pickup. They refused, giving excuses, which was surprising for a brand like Hilton.

During dining, the staff seemed more focused on reminding guests to pay the bill rather than offering a warm dining experience. At least four staff members came, one after the other, just to remind me to settle the bill. No one even asked how the food was.

At check-out, I politely asked if I could go back to the room for a quick change of clothes, or if they could provide a small space. The response was a blunt ‚Äúyou can use the restroom, no other place will be allowed.‚Äù Not something you'd expect from a hospitality-first brand.

While the property itself is well-maintained, the staff attitude and service levels need serious improvement. I truly hope the management addresses these issues so future guests have a better experience.",2025-08-03T17:15:13.484082538Z,a month ago

I would like to especially appreciate SALMAN from the laundry service. He was very courteous, prompt, and handled my requests with great care. The clothes were returned fresh, neatly done, and on time. His dedication and friendly attitude deserve special recognition.",2025-08-11T17:02:52.489506129Z,3 weeks ago

luc001,luc001_r5,My Mentor,1,"Food Quality and Service:

The overall quality of the food was subpar. Many attendees tasted the food but left their plates unfinished. Notably, chapatis were not served, and soup was unavailable. The excessive use of garlic in the dishes was also a common complaint among guests.

The food service appeared disorganized, giving the impression that it was complimentary rather than part of a paid event.

Service Staff Availability:

There was a noticeable lack of service staff attending to our VIP guests. Despite prior requests, no one approached them to offer tea, coffee, or other refreshments. We had to assign our own staff to ensure our guests were attended to appropriately.

Lack of Banquet Infrastructure:
Normally when we do our events at Taj, Lucknow, there is no dearth of front row sofas there. We had to struggle to find 6 wooden chairs at max, around 10 am, after the start of our program, to be placed for our special guests. When hotels like your offer such experience and availability of paraphernalia, it seems like a waste of money and trust bestowed.

This experience was disappointing.

luc006,luc006_r1,S.K. Dubey,1,"Dear Hotel Holiday Inn Team,

I am writing to share my recent experiences at your hotel, which have raised concerns about the food safety and hygiene standards. On August 12th, around 22:35, I dined at your evening buffet and was served Chicken Malai. Unfortunately, upon inspecting the dish, I found a hair in it. I immediately brought this to the attention of the Floor Chef and Duty Manager, who took the issue seriously and apologized for the inconvenience.

The Chef and Duty Manager offered to replace the dish, but given the nature of the issue, I decided not to continue with my meal. As a guest, it's unsettling to encounter such an incident, and it raises questions about the quality control measures in place.

Furthermore, I had a similar experience the previous day when I requested your floor team to send some fresh dishes from the buffet to my room as I returned late from a site visit. To my surprise, I received leftover food from the buffet, which was not what I had requested. This incident not only raised concerns about food handling but also made me question whether the hotel was prioritizing cost savings over serving fresh food to guests.

While I appreciate the prompt response from the Chef and Duty Manager regarding the hair incident, these experiences collectively raise concerns about the overall food safety and hygiene standards at your hotel. I understand that mistakes can happen, but I hope you'll take this feedback constructively and review your quality control processes to ensure the highest standards of food safety and hygiene.

I hope that you will take my feedback seriously and take necessary actions to address these concerns. I look forward to hearing from you and seeing improvements in your Service.",2025-08-13T08:02:34.859769335Z,3 weeks ago

After using the swimming pool, I went to the gym shower where I found no hair oil, wet slippers, no laundry bag, and even the telephone was not working. There was also no staff present to assist.

Even though I was assured multiple times that items were being sent, nobody ever came, and I wasted 30+ minutes waiting.

Worse, when I returned later from my meeting, I discovered that hotel staff had accessed my room without my permission. This is a serious breach of privacy and security, completely unacceptable in any hotel‚Äîlet alone one under the Taj brand.

Despite escalating this matter to the duty manager, there was no proper resolution or accountability. The service was unprofessional, careless, and far below the standards one expects from a 5-star property.

I haven't seen a better house phone booth ever in any hotel and telling you by the experience of staying across the World. House phone booth has statues in local dresses and you have to see them to believe it.

The swimming pool looks like it is from the Mughal era. There is a water fountain inside and around it.

luc010,luc010_r5,Choco Vanilla,1,"**Disastrous Experience at Hotel Damson Plum**

My stay at Hotel Damson Plum was, without exaggeration, the worst hotel experience I have ever had. From the moment I arrived, I was met with unprofessional and indifferent staff at the front desk who seemed uninterested in guest concerns. The check-in process was unnecessarily slow and chaotic.

Upon entering my room, I was immediately disappointed by the lack of cleanliness. The bathroom had visible stains and a lingering unpleasant odor, and the towels provided were worn and scratchy. The bed linens appeared to be old and not properly laundered. Despite the hotel‚Äôs claim of modern amenities, I found the air conditioning barely functional and the Wi-Fi connection unreliable throughout my stay.

The noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms was constant, making it impossible to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. Housekeeping was inconsistent‚Äîsome days my room was not cleaned at all, and when it was, it was done poorly.

The food quality in the restaurant was below par. The breakfast buffet was limited and lacked freshness, with several items running out quickly and not being replenished. Service in the restaurant was slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed and inattentive.

The location, while near Lulu Mall, was not as convenient as advertised, and the area felt isolated at night. The hotel‚Äôs value for money is questionable given the poor quality of service and amenities.

Overall, I would strongly advise against staying at Hotel Damson Plum. There are much better options in Lucknow for a similar price, and this hotel did not live up to any of its promises.",2025-06-13T12:23:35.384252Z,2 months ago

Rooms was nice, spacious, proper amenities inside room with a locker too. The location is great from railway station, airport and all the older food joints of Lucknow. Quite ambience inside the hotel too. Good things ends here.
Bathroom has been leaking, so no point of wet and dry area. The water mixer was broken, had to use it in the last adjusted setting which was super hot for August. The commode too was leaking. Had to wait for 1 hour 30 minutes before a room was allotted. We were told initially to wait for 30 minutes, waited patiently, then 15 minutes, towards the it got me, went to the counter and asked them how much more, said 10 minutes and the saga continues. They have been constantly saying that ""Sorry we are fully booked that's why the delay"". We are not staying free, people pay, so if booked fully manage your workforce, instead of placing 1 intern and 1 front desk guy. Yes, I accept we reached early at 12.45 PM, and the check-in time was officially 2 PM, but we also have informed that at the time of booking itself. Should have responded then and there. We could have booked something else. Worst service I have ever seen in the same category of hotels. And moreover if you need time, spill it out at once not like 30 minutes, 15 minutes and continuing.

Cleanliness: The hotel lacked basic hygiene. The rooms were dirty and had a bad odor, making the stay very uncomfortable.

Staff Behavior: The staff was untrained and unprofessional. They did not even know how to greet guests properly, which is very concerning for a hotel of this claimed standard.

Room Condition: The AC in the room was not working properly. I raised the issue at the reception, but there was no response or follow-up. The room condition overall was poor and not well-maintained.

Service: There was no promptness or courtesy in their service. Complaints were ignored, and no effort was made to improve the situation.

Overall, this was one of the worst hotel stays I have ever experienced. I would strongly advise others to avoid this place. It does not live up to its advertised rating and feels more like a fraud than a professional establishment.

I had booked a room for two guests (non-refundable booking), as I wanted to stay with my friend who is a local resident of Lucknow. However, the hotel denied his entry, stating their ""local ID policy."" Despite repeated discussions with the front desk and several attempts to explain, they refused to listen or make any exceptions.

As a result, I was forced to stay alone in a room booked for two, which felt unfair since I had paid for double occupancy. The management showed no flexibility or customer concern.

For the remaining days, I moved to another nearby hotel, which was much better in every aspect‚Äîcleaner, friendlier, and most importantly, they allowed genuine guest access to rooms without unnecessary restrictions.

The room washroom was unsafe, with no proper bath mats, making the floor completely slippery.

Food quality was average at best, and the service was extremely slow due to very limited staff in the restaurant.

Some of the staff were not welcoming at all, and the receptionist was outright rude, which left a very negative impression.

From booking to check-out, there was a lot of confusion and lack of proper communication, making the entire stay stressful instead of comfortable.

My flight landed at 7 AM, and I had already spoken to the hotel beforehand requesting an early check-in. Unfortunately, despite the room being vacant, we were made to wait two hours before being given the keys. I understand hotel policies may not allow early check-in more than four hours before standard time, but what was disappointing was that even during those two hours in the lobby, it took them an hour just to serve us a glass of water.

The suite itself is spacious, with two bathrooms, a sitting area, and a bedroom. However, I learned that the property is 15 years old, and it shows. The room has wooden paneling on all walls, but the storage space is limited‚Äîjust one cupboard, which is inadequate for even two people. The mattress was slightly smaller than the bed, affecting the aesthetics. The room had a musty smell, like it hadn‚Äôt been aired out in a while. The bathroom is large with a bathtub, but the fittings, mirror, and toilet look old and in need of replacement. There was no hot water during my first day. The French windows in both the bedroom and sitting area have visible water stains, which affect the view. Outside the room, the passageway has water dripping from the roof, possibly from AC vents.

I requested a room freshener to deal with the musty smell, but it never arrived. The reception staff were polite but not particularly warm‚Äîeverything was handled in a matter-of-fact way without much hospitality.

On the positive side, the location is excellent‚Äîright in the Hazratganj area, close to all major tourist spots in Lucknow. I‚Äôve only stayed one night so far, so let‚Äôs see how tomorrow goes.",2025-08-15T21:21:32.694402981Z,3 weeks ago

During this stay, I faced significant inconvenience due to non-functional air conditioning. Despite changing rooms three times, I was not provided a room with a properly working AC:

Room 4115 ‚Äì AC was completely non-functional.

Room 4114 ‚Äì AC not cooling, no fridge, broken mirror, faulty flush, and several non-working lights.

Room 4112 ‚Äì AC worked for about 2 hours and then stopped cooling altogether.

While the staff was courteous and tried to be supportive, they were unable to resolve the issue. I now understand why each room has a ceiling fan ‚Äî seemingly to compensate for malfunctioning AC units, which is not expected at this price point or standard of service.

This follows an earlier disappointing experience:
Last year, I had to cancel my booking due to a sudden family emergency. I had informed the management in good faith and was verbally assured a credit for a future stay, with no terms discussed at the time. However, when I reached out 10 months later to utilize that credit, I was told that the credit validity was only 3 months ‚Äî a condition that was never communicated earlier. Despite multiple requests, not even a complimentary meal was offered as a goodwill gesture.

Both experiences reflect poorly on guest service and post-booking support. I hope you will take this feedback seriously and work toward improving both the maintenance of your property and transparency in guest communication.",2025-07-07T09:42:41.156313570Z,2 months ago

Despite raising complaints, there was no proper response. The toilets were extremely dirty, and cleanliness was clearly not a priority.

The room had not been cleaned after the previous guests, with unmade beds and unchanged sheets. When we requested fresh linens, we were told the laundry staff wasn‚Äôt available, so nothing could be done immediately. The washrooms were in a filthy state, yet despite raising concerns, no effort was made to address the issue.

To make matters worse, the room boy, Vikas, was incredibly rude and behaved as if he had more authority than the manager. Instead of addressing our concerns, he had the audacity to say, 'Ma‚Äôam, you may check out if you're not satisfied.' Things escalated when he snatched the keys from us and even went as far as threatening to lock us in the room if we didn‚Äôt leave. In an unfamiliar location, this was not just unprofessional but outright dangerous. How can guests feel safe in a place where employees behave this way?

The level of unprofessionalism, lack of hospitality, and outright hostility were beyond anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. I would strongly advise against staying here unless serious changes are made to both the staff and management.",2025-02-18T15:36:44.134732Z,6 months ago
luc065,luc065_r2,Amul Agrawal,4,"Hotel Vills offers budget-friendly accommodations in Lucknow, making it a solid choice for travelers looking for spacious rooms at an affordable price. The rooms are well-maintained and provide ample space, ensuring a comfortable stay. The location is convenient, though it comes with its challenges.

One drawback is the lack of dedicated parking. Guests have to park their vehicles on the road, which is narrow and allows only one car to pass at a time. This can be inconvenient, especially if another vehicle approaches from the opposite direction, as it requires reversing to make way.

The property has been converted from a house into a guest house, but the transformation has been handled well. It retains a cozy, homely vibe while offering the services expected in a hotel. The staff is courteous and attentive, which adds to the positive experience.

I stayed at this hotel recently for an important visit, as I had to appear for the PCS Mains exam. Unfortunately, my experience was not as smooth as expected. Despite having a confirmed booking, the hotel staff informed me upon arrival that my room was not available, and they shifted me to another hotel for the first night.

Though they did arrange a pickup and drop service to and from the alternate hotel, the whole shifting process caused a lot of inconvenience. I had specifically chosen this hotel for its peaceful environment and proximity to the exam center, but the unexpected change disturbed my preparation and routine, especially as I had to move again the next day before finally checking in here.

The room I finally got was decent, and the staff was polite. However, I feel that such last-minute arrangements are not acceptable when guests are arriving for something as crucial as a competitive exam.

Would only recommend if the hotel improves its booking reliability and avoids such unnecessary disruptions.",2025-07-03T20:43:29.644777029Z,2 months ago

luc086,luc086_r2,Sumit Bhan Singh,2,"During our stay, one of the most disappointing aspects was the parking facility, which turned out to be highly misleading. At the time of booking and even upon arrival, the property claimed that it had its own parking arrangements. Since parking was an important requirement for us, we made it a point to ask the staff clearly whether safe and secure parking was available. They assured us that the vehicles would be parked outside in their designated space and would be monitored by their security guard. Based on this assurance, we trusted their words and left our vehicle as instructed.

However, to our shock and dismay, when we came to collect our vehicle at the time of checkout, we noticed a huge dent on the front door along with visible damage. This was not only upsetting but also deeply inconvenient for us. What made the matter worse was the attitude of the management and staff. Instead of addressing the issue responsibly, they simply kept passing the matter from one person to another. No one was ready to take accountability, and the entire response felt dismissive and unprofessional.

This incident left us extremely uncomfortable and unhappy. A guest‚Äôs vehicle is their responsibility once they claim to provide parking, but here there was no proper security, no ownership, and no solution offered.

luc095,luc095_r4,Veeresh Mishra,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience ‚Äì Misleading Listing and Unprofessional Conduct

I recently booked this hotel through Ixigo, and the experience was extremely disappointing from the outset. The property was advertised with photos and descriptions that suggested it was comparable to a 4-star establishment. However, upon arrival, it became immediately apparent that the room was in a highly unsanitary and unhygienic condition, bearing no resemblance to the listing.

The conduct of the hotel staff, including the owner, was unprofessional and overtly disrespectful. Despite having a confirmed and prepaid booking, we were treated as if we were unwelcome guests. When I raised my concerns with Ixigo, their initial response was to advise me to ""adjust"" and settle the matter directly with the hotel, asserting that they were not liable for the quality of service provided by the property.

When I requested a cancellation and refund, both Ixigo and the hotel refused. After a 30-minute delay, the hotel staff contacted me and, in a hostile tone, demanded that I vacate the room within 2 minutes or risk forfeiting the entire booking amount. Their manner bordered on verbal abuse and created a distressing environment.

Following multiple escalations and discussions, Ixigo eventually agreed to issue a refund. However, the overall experience was deeply unpleasant and mismanaged.

Key Takeaways:

Deceptive Advertising: Actual conditions did not match the photos or description on the booking platform.

Unhygienic Premises: Rooms were in an unacceptable state of cleanliness.

Unprofessional Behavior: Staff exhibited extremely rude and aggressive behavior.

Poor Conflict Resolution: Both the hotel and Ixigo were initially uncooperative and dismissive.

Final Resolution: Refund issued only after considerable effort and repeated follow-ups.

Staff Behavior Rating: 0/5
Recommendation: Prospective guests are strongly advised to verify the authenticity of listings through third-party reviews or direct confirmation before booking.

Literally they put some old mattress on a old stand which is like making s big whole in the centre when you sleep or even sit. The AC was loud and old which was throwing bad smell in this July rainy season. The bathroom was totally no no. The Easter seat of the toilet is literally in the corner of the building so close to the wall that you can't sit on it properly. The water flow is bad in the bathroom which will accumulate on the washroom entrance keeping it always wet and stinky. No sir fresheners no toiletries no exhaust in the bathroom.

From the start, things just felt off. The room I was given was poorly maintained ‚Äî dusty furniture, worn-out bedsheets, and a bathroom that didn‚Äôt feel clean or cared for. There was no attention to detail, no sense of hospitality.
But what really shocked me was the fact that they didn‚Äôt even provide a toothbrush and toothpaste. When I asked the staff politely, I was told outright, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt give that here.‚Äù No apology, no explanation ‚Äî just a flat-out refusal. For a hotel that calls itself ""Prime"", I at least expected basic hygiene items.
The location is also quite misleading. Though it says ‚ÄúHazratganj,‚Äù it‚Äôs not in the main market area. The surroundings felt shady at night and it was difficult to find proper food or transport nearby. Definitely not ideal for a traveler unfamiliar with the area.
As for service, it was completely unprofessional. Staff were unresponsive, housekeeping took forever (if they responded at all), and there was no sense of responsibility from the management. No one seemed interested in making the guest feel welcome or comfortable.
Overall, this place felt like it was running on auto-pilot ‚Äî no cleanliness, no proper amenities, and no customer service.
Not recommended at all. I hope the management seriously takes this feedback and improves, because as it stands now, FabHotel Prime V Hazratganj is far from ‚Äúfab‚Äù or ‚Äúprime.‚Äù",2025-07-23T10:34:55.030964474Z,a month ago

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. This is by far the most unprofessional and poorly managed hostel I‚Äôve ever stayed in.
1.	They double-booked my bed. Yes, you read that right! They assigned me a bed that was already taken. Imagine settling in after a long, exhausting journey, only to be woken up in the middle of the night because of their mistake.
2.	No staff available to fix their screw-up. When I needed help, there was no one around. It was absolute chaos.
3.	They were rude and dismissive. Instead of apologizing for their incompetence, they told me to move like it was my fault. No compensation, no refund, not even the slightest concern for their guests.
4.	Terrible customer service. When I asked for some kind of concession for their blunder, they refused and acted like I was the problem. No accountability whatsoever.

And to bear all this, you will have to climb to 4rth floor with your luggage because guess what, there is no lift in this wonderful hostel.(which is never mentioned in details)

Most of the other places had poorly maintained rooms or unpleasant odors from the bathrooms, which made them unsuitable‚Äîespecially for international travelers like us.

Vinayaka Lifestyles truly stood out with its high standards and attention to detail. From the moment we stepped in, the service was impeccable. The staff was warm, helpful, and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. We had an early morning departure, and they were extremely flexible and accommodating with our schedule. We booked four rooms and all of them were in good shape.

The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully arranged‚Äîeverything we needed for a restful night. The hotel‚Äôs location is also ideal: close to the railway station and surrounded by great shopping areas, which made it even more convenient.

The staff, service and the banquet staff is highly unprofessional.
Just celebrated my daughter‚Äôs first birthday.

When the party was over and we handed over the room keys. They did not ask for room money even though we asked them telling that it‚Äôs complimentary. We used the room only for two hours.

From next day, started their harrowing calls like we ran away with their money.
After charging lakhs of rupees, they started harassing us with a petty amount of 3000/- that too for using the room only for 2 hours which they told us as complimentary.

My question is how can you call someone and ask for money which you only told as complimentary. In the end we did pay them the petty amount just for our peace of mind.

The experience has been pathetic since the start. Even for dish selection, the banquet people were creating such a fuss like its some 5 star hotel, which honestly it is not esp when you look at their staff and service.

I would recommend not to take their banquet services at all and save some peace of mind.

Update: The harassing calls did not stop even after paying the anount. Someone called Shalini called is again to ask why you gave a bad review.

Also, it is the hotel‚Äôs responsibility not to give something complementary if they want to harass customers later on.
We waited in the reception to pay the amount but the hotel staff did not take it saying its complimentary, so its solely hotel‚Äôs responsibility. Educate your staff on complimentary things before harassing the customers.

I was made to wait outside for 20 minutes arguing with the guards, despite explaining multiple times that I had already checked in and provided all necessary documents. The level of disrespect was unbelievable.

Staying at The Grace Residency was one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made while traveling. The name is completely misleading ‚Äî there is no ""grace,"" and certainly no ""residency"" worth staying in.

My advice? Stay far away. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the polished photos online ‚Äî it‚Äôs all a scam. There are plenty of better places to stay that actually treat guests with basic respect and deliver what they promise. This isn‚Äôt one of them.

One more thing: even after booking through Booking.com, they called and demanded payment in advance to ""confirm"" the reservation ‚Äî something that wasn‚Äôt mentioned on the site. This place is dirty, disorganized, and treats paying guests like intruders. No hospitality, no comfort, no vibe ‚Äî just stress.

If this review is still up, consider yourself warned. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.",2025-06-06T19:31:30.862082951Z,3 months ago
luc133,luc133_r3,Shreya Verma,1,"My stay at The Grace Regency, Lucknow, was extremely disappointing from the moment I arrived.

First, there was an unnecessary long wait at check-in. Despite being on the 5th floor, I had to carry my own luggage as no staff offered help. Inside the lift, another guest/staff member was loudly abusing someone over the phone ‚Äî very unprofessional atmosphere.

The hotel looks nothing like the pictures shown online. When I finally reached the floor, the staff hadn‚Äôt brought the room key and was busy on the phone, showing complete mismanagement and no coordination. I was left standing in the corridor for 20‚Äì25 minutes with my luggage before they opened the room.

Room condition:
‚Ä¢	Loose, damaged door locks ‚Äî when I complained, staff didn‚Äôt fix it but instead showed me a ‚Äútrick‚Äù to lock it. Seriously? I was staying alone ‚Äî safety should be a priority, not a DIY hack.
‚Ä¢	Washroom tap dripping continuously ‚Äî I complained 2 hours earlier and, out of frustration, even said, ‚ÄúSend the cleaning agents, I‚Äôll fix it myself.‚Äù They simply replied, ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Pan masala packets left behind in the washroom ‚Äî clear sign it was not cleaned properly
‚Ä¢	Bedsheet, quilt, and pillows were not clean
‚Ä¢	Landline phone not working
‚Ä¢	Low battery in TV remote ‚Äî when I informed staff, they casually told me to use the AC remote batteries instead. I told them my mind works and I had already done that before even calling.

Amenities:
‚Ä¢	Only small bottles of shampoo, bath wash, a paper roll, and possibly handwash in the bathroom
‚Ä¢	In the kitchen: kettle, 2 sugar sachets, 2 milk powder sachets, 2 tea bags, 2 glasses, and 1 cup with tray
‚Ä¢	Refrigerator was fine, no dripping
‚Ä¢	No hair dryer provided despite being listed
‚Ä¢	Charged ‚Çπ10 extra per water bottle (over MRP)
‚Ä¢	Charged ‚Çπ50 extra for a dental kit which was supposed to be included in amenities

The only positive point ‚Äî the first pantry staff member I interacted with was polite and professional. After that, the rest? Complete silence ‚Äî either indifferent or unresponsive.

Overall, the hygiene was poor, staff service was careless, safety was compromised, and management seemed completely unorganized. Definitely not worth the money, and I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a safe, comfortable, or professional stay.

luc133,luc133_r5,Jignesh Rathod,1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience ‚Äì A Month of Repeated Negligence

I have been staying at this property for over a month now, and unfortunately, the experience has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. Despite raising several concerns through multiple calls and reminders, there has been no meaningful action taken by the management.

To begin with, the condition of the room furniture is not only poor but outright hazardous. One of our team members sustained a cut from an exposed iron plate on a piece of furniture ‚Äî a serious safety issue that was neither acknowledged nor addressed. This level of negligence is unacceptable, especially when guests‚Äô well-being is at risk.

The breakfast menu is monotonous and lacks any variety. Every single day, it consists of the same items ‚Äî poha and puri bhaji. There has been absolutely no effort to introduce any changes or improvements, which reflects poorly on the service quality and attention to guest satisfaction.

Housekeeping is another major concern. Room cleaning is routinely done after 5 PM, which is highly inconvenient. On several occasions, the rooms were not cleaned at all, with no explanation or apology offered.

The bathroom conditions are equally dismal. The water in the flush is visibly dirty, and there's no designated space to place soap or toiletries while bathing. Basic amenities that one expects from any hotel are simply missing here.

Additionally, the infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Many doors are broken or damaged, and the door knobs are so tight they are difficult to operate, adding to daily inconvenience.

Overall, the stay has been a difficult and unpleasant experience due to the consistent lack of upkeep, poor hygiene standards, and an unresponsive management. These are fundamental issues that cannot be overlooked.",2025-05-31T14:32:21.065028Z,3 months ago

luc148,luc148_r1,Merina Gupta,1,"Worst Experience Ever ‚Äì Do Not Book!

This place is a total scam ‚Äì overpriced, untrustworthy, and unsafe. Do NOT book here if you value your money or your safety.

I had the worst experience with OYO and the property I booked! I was supposed to stay for 2 days but checked out after just 3.5 hours. The property was in terrible condition:

Broken doors ‚Äì Couldn‚Äôt even secure them properly.
Broken lock on the main door ‚Äì Totally unsafe!
No water in the bathroom ‚Äì Completely useless.
Unsafe environment ‚Äì This place is not suitable for families or women.
To top it off, the owner is lying, saying I checked out after 1 PM when I left at 9:30 AM. OYO isn‚Äôt even taking my proof seriously! I‚Äôve provided evidence, but it feels like they don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs like they trust the lying property owner more than their own customers.

I paid for a service I didn‚Äôt get and felt unsafe the entire time. OYO, fix this and give me my refund. You can‚Äôt just let this kind of thing slide. Never booking with OYO again!",2025-02-23T17:59:43.564204Z,6 months ago
