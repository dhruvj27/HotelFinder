This area also houses the kids' play activities like carrom, archery, etc. Unfortunately, the ceiling was leaking, making the floor wet and slippery, which isn\u2019t safe \u2013 especially for children and elderly guests. We hope the management takes note of this and fixes it soon, as it\u2019s a lovely space otherwise.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the resort and would definitely recommend it for a relaxing getaway.

When I brought up an issue, they weren't supportive at all and didn't seem to care about resolving the problem. Very poor customer service.

This is a newer property with several Instagrammable spots like their pool and garden.

The rooms are well designed and love that the shower has a door and a high divider so water doesn\u2019t spill out when taking a shower. Breakfast is a FULL LUXURY experience with endless options catering to multicultural taste palettes and each item is authentically cooked. Dee in the breakfast area is super kind and helpful and honestly goes above to offer any assistance needed. I really appreciated that the breakfast staff allowed me to take breakfast to my room while I was unwell so I could eat at a slower pace. Housekeeping is PHENOMENAL\u2026they tidy and clean your room as meticulously as shown in the book, \u201cThe Girl with a Pearl Earring\u201d where it\u2019s cleaned while keeping your things as you would want to find them. A small suggestion for improvement would be consistent temperature across different spaces and perhaps a bit more attention to non spicy food requirements by in room dining which was fixed immediately after mentioned. Overall, I truly enjoyed my stay and would recommend to everyone! The staff here really does an incredible job to make the stay as wonderful as possible for each guest. Hands down this is the 5 star experience you don\u2019t want to miss!",

It was not only unpleasant to look at but also affected the overall feel of the room. Additionally, since the room was on a lower floor facing another building, we had to keep our curtains closed all the time to maintain privacy \u2014 which completely defeated the purpose of a relaxing, well-lit room.\n\nI spoke with a representative over the phone who assured me that the team would call me back regarding the room change \u2014 no one ever did. I also raised the issue at the reception counter and while the staff there was willing to help, by then half of my stay was already over, making the change pointless.\n\nAnother concern was the food pricing and quantity. While I understand and accept premium pricing at such properties, the portion sizes were surprisingly small \u2014 not sufficient even for two people. If the prices are on the higher end, then the quantity should justify it.\n\nOverall, apart from the entrance and lobby area which gives a five-star impression, the rest of the experience did not live up to the standards one would expect from such a property.

The thoughtfulness exhibited by staff member of every department made it very heartwarming and pleasant environment to be around. Its a pity we were only there for one night the first time but did not think twice of staying anywhere else a month later with such a delightful experience. The food was delicious and authentic. The facilities are very well maintained as well and cleanliness and hygiene is outstanding. Just writing this review brings back a smile of the pleasant memories.",

This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as a 5-star luxury establishment.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into the elegant lobby, I was greeted by the warm and professional staff. Check-in was a breeze, and the staff made sure all my preferences were noted. The attention to detail was evident throughout my stay.\n\nThe room I stayed in was nothing short of magnificent. The spacious layout, tasteful decor, and stunning views of the Arabian Sea were breathtaking. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. The amenities provided were top-notch, and the room service was prompt and efficient.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was dining at the hotel's restaurants. The culinary offerings were a true delight for the senses. Whether I was indulging in traditional Indian cuisine or savoring international dishes, each meal was a gastronomic journey. The service at the restaurants was impeccable, and the staff's knowledge of the menu was impressive.\n\nThe hotel's location in Nariman Point is also a major plus. It's conveniently situated near major business and leisure attractions, making it an ideal choice for both business travelers and tourists.\n\nThe hotel's facilities, including the fitness center and spa, were top-of-the-line. I particularly enjoyed unwinding at the spa after a long day of exploring the city.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at the Trident Hotel Nariman Point was nothing short of remarkable.

I truly enjoyed starting my day with a delicious and satisfying meal.\n\nMoreover, the staff at the restaurant were incredibly friendly and accommodating. They were always ready to assist and provide recommendations, making me feel like a valued guest.

The amenities were modern and in great condition, ensuring a comfortable and convenient stay. The housekeeping staff did an exceptional job in keeping the rooms tidy and refreshing the supplies.\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the entire team at Fairfield by Marriott for their dedication and commitment to creating a welcoming and pleasant environment for guests.

The 15 floor+ rooms have a sea view along with the skyline. We were on the Westside so saw the Marine drive lighting very well.\n\nThe breakfast spread is elaborate. They had some local favorites like pohe and sabudana khichadi and also typical five star offerings like eggs to order, South Indian, various pastries, cheeses, and corn flakes with options of oat milk and soy milk as well. Liked their filter coffee too.\n\nThe in room service was prompt after a call. We needed extra towel, drinking water and in room tea coffee satchets and all was provided in just few mins. Kudos on using the glass bottles and being environmentally conscious.\n\nLoved how soft spoken and smiling the entire staff treated us.

                "text": "This is the best value for money place. The staff is very polite and thoughtful. The rooms are a bit small but it's Mumbai so can't expect more than that. The 15 floor+ rooms have a sea view along with the skyline. We were on the Westside so saw the Marine drive lighting very well.\n\nThe breakfast spread is elaborate. They had some local favorites like pohe and sabudana khichadi and also typical five star offerings like eggs to order, South Indian, various pastries, cheeses, and corn flakes with options of oat milk and soy milk as well. Liked their filter coffee too.\n\nThe in room service was prompt after a call. We needed extra towel, drinking water and in room tea coffee satchets and all was provided in just few mins. Kudos on using the glass bottles and being environmentally conscious.\n\nLoved how soft spoken and smiling the entire staff treated us.

A five-star hotel is characterized by meticulous attention to detail, exceptional amenities, and an ability to anticipate guests' needs long before they arise.\n\nImagine walking into a five-star hotel lobby; the ambiance bathes you in elegance, with marble floors, exquisite chandeliers, and tasteful artwork adorning the walls.

Spacious rooms and suites often come with stunning views, luxurious furnishings, and the latest technology. High-end bedding, plush robes, and well-stocked minibars create an oasis of comfort.

Business travelers benefit from fully equipped meeting rooms and concierge services, making work and leisure seamlessly intertwined.\n\nFinally, the location of a five-star hotel often enhances its allure. Positioned in prime areas\u2014be it a bustling city center, a serene beach, or a scenic mountain\u2014guests can easily explore the surrounding attractions, cultural sites, and natural beauty. The combination of luxurious accommodations, exceptional service, and prime location ensures that a stay at a five-star hotel is more than just a getaway; it\u2019s an experience that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nIn summary, a five-star hotel is an epitome of luxury and refinement.

Couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\n\nIt should be an example for every hotel in India on how customer centric an hotel should be, and what hospitality should mean. Thanks to entire Planet Hollywood team for everything!",

The hotel's elegant ambiance, coupled with impeccable service, made my stay truly memorable.\n\nFrom the moment I walked into the lobby, I was greeted by a warm and attentive staff. The rooms are tastefully decorated, offering a perfect blend of comfort and sophistication. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the room, from the plush bedding to the well-appointed amenities.\n\nThe culinary experience at Trident Hotel Bandra Kurla is exceptional. The diverse range of dining options caters to every palate, and the quality of the food is outstanding. Whether it was breakfast at the restaurant or a late-night snack from room service, each dish was a culinary delight.\n\nThe hotel's location in Bandra Kurla Complex is convenient, with easy access to business districts and shopping areas. Yet, once inside the hotel, you are transported to a tranquil oasis, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nI must commend the staff for their professionalism and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure a delightful stay. Their commitment to guest satisfaction is truly commendable.\n\nIn conclusion, Trident Hotel Bandra Kurla is a haven of luxury and comfort in the heart of Mumbai. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a top-notch hospitality experience. I look forward to my next visit!",
