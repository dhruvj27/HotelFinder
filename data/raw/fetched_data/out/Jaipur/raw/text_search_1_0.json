The staff was incredibly humble and always eager to assist. I would give hospitality a glowing 10 out of 5! Special thanks to Mr.Pradip, who went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. He made us feel at home, especially when our kids were feeling uneasy. Even organizing our transportation to the airport and ensuring we left with cherished memories of Jaipur went beyond their responsibilities, yet they excelled at it. We highly recommend this Taj property!",

But as soon as we reached, we had to carry our luggage ourselves to the reception because there was no bell boy available to help. We checked in a room but the curtains there were torn, so they shifted us to another room. As soon as we entered the another room, the room was so small that even our luggage bag could not be opened. The balcony was also very small. When we complained at the reception that these were not the category of rooms that we had booked, the receptionist said that this is heritage property and all the rooms here are same. The pictures on the internet are just for reference. We were very surprised but they ignored us. The tea bags provided in the rooms were also open and not in proper packaging, which is below standard for a heritage property. When we tried to turn on the TV, we found out that the set top box was faulty. The housekeeping staff tried to fix the TV for half an hour but finally said sorry and left. Then our wifi was also not working so we complained to the reception twice but still we did not get any help. Our booking was for 2 days but we immediately cancelled our bookings for the next day and booked in another hotel. Because there is no point in staying where guests' comfort is not taken care of. Decor and food was good. Otherwise service needs improvement.\nSo our stay at Umaid Bhawan Royal Style Heritage Boutique Hotel was nothing special.",

When we checked in, there was a small problem with the room we had booked, so he couldn\u2019t give us that exact one. But he handled it quickly, helped us as much as he could, and gave us another room that was very comfortable \u2014 even better than we expected.\n\nThis hotel is very unique \u2014 it was the most memorable one on our whole trip. It was started in 1993 by a former royal family from Borunda. The whole place has a royal Rajasthani style, like an old palace, with carved balconies and a rooftop restaurant. Staying here felt like traveling back in time\u2026 almost like being royalty!\n\nThe hotel breakfast was also great, with many tasty options. The staff were very kind and welcoming. If you ever visit Jaipur, you should definitely stay here for a night\u2014or even a few nights. You won\u2019t regret it :)",

Let me summarize the good and bad.\n\nGood:\n* Location is good for business travelers and for those using their own cars.\n* The quality of lunch and dinner preparations was excellent, mostly because it is made to order.\n* Overall upkeep of the hotel is good.\n* The waiting staff in the restaurant was perhaps the most polite I\u2019ve found in Rajasthan.\n\nBad:\n* Check-in was slow.\n* The reception and lobby was located on the first floor, unlike most other hotels where it is up front at the entrance. This is always a surprise to a new guest, who generally expect it to be at the front door of the hotel.\n* The bed was uncomfortable. Maybe this was only in my room but it is worth noting.\n* The obsession with QR code for the restaurant menu. I know it\u2019s a cost cutting measure but come on Red Fox! You can do better than most other budget hotels by simply adding a physical menu to your services.\n* The breakfast was just about average.\n* The closets in the rooms should at least have a sliding door to keep things safe. Not having it is another cost cutting measure but surely it can be addressed.\n\nFinally, I must appreciate the differently abled staff members. I saw two of them and their energy was unmatched! A big thumbs up to them. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

My partner and I are from New Zealand and we didn\u2019t have a pleasant experience here and that is putting it nicely. We walked in at around 3pm and they were still cleaning the entire floor after having a wedding function there. There was literal rubbish and dirt in the hallway which was being swept out of each of the rooms. We had to dodge all that while walking to our room. Our room was really run down and still seemed dirty. The AC wasn\u2019t working. My partner opened up one of the cupboards to be blasted with an overwhelming smell of urine. He closed it immediately and didn\u2019t open it for the rest of the time we were staying there. Later on in the evening our entire room started smelling of urine/ sewer. None of the bathrooms had separation glass or curtain between the shower, toilet or sink so once we had a shower, the whole bathroom floor became wet. We had to have cold bucket showers on the first night as the shower head wasn\u2019t working and hot water wasn\u2019t coming out. We had other family members staying in other rooms so I asked them if their showers were working and they had the same situation as we did. We addressed this with the staff on the night and they said they will get someone to try to fix it in the morning. We don\u2019t know if they fixed it because we moved to another room where we made sure the shower head was working as well as the hot water, AC and the room smelt some what okay. Someone else moved into our room and I noticed that as we walked past the room, the overwhelming smell of sewage was still present. Also, we caught a glimpse of the mattress protector that we were sleeping on while they were moving our rooms and it was absolutely disgusting - picture attached. The place itself is located close-ish to the city centre and it was easy to get an uber and the food is nice - those are the only positive things I can say about this place.\n\nMy partner and I would\u2019ve moved out of the place as soon as we saw it however, we had 20 or so other family members staying there for a wedding so we tolerated it to the best of our abilities. My entire group caught a cold by the end of our stay because of the conditions of the hotel. I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE.",

There was literal rubbish and dirt in the hallway which was being swept out of each of the rooms. We had to dodge all that while walking to our room. Our room was really run down and still seemed dirty. The AC wasn\u2019t working. My partner opened up one of the cupboards to be blasted with an overwhelming smell of urine. He closed it immediately and didn\u2019t open it for the rest of the time we were staying there. Later on in the evening our entire room started smelling of urine/ sewer. None of the bathrooms had separation glass or curtain between the shower, toilet or sink so once we had a shower, the whole bathroom floor became wet. We had to have cold bucket showers on the first night as the shower head wasn\u2019t working and hot water wasn\u2019t coming out. We had other family members staying in other rooms so I asked them if their showers were working and they had the same situation as we did. We addressed this with the staff on the night and they said they will get someone to try to fix it in the morning. We don\u2019t know if they fixed it because we moved to another room where we made sure the shower head was working as well as the hot water, AC and the room smelt some what okay. Someone else moved into our room and I noticed that as we walked past the room, the overwhelming smell of sewage was still present. Also, we caught a glimpse of the mattress protector that we were sleeping on while they were moving our rooms and it was absolutely disgusting - picture attached. The place itself is located close-ish to the city centre and it was easy to get an uber and the food is nice - those are the only positive things I can say about this place.\n\nMy partner and I would\u2019ve moved out of the place as soon as we saw it however, we had 20 or so other family members staying there for a wedding so we tolerated it to the best of our abilities. My entire group caught a cold by the end of our stay because of the conditions of the hotel. I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE.",

Unfortunately, our experience turned out to be nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nAround 11 PM on the night 1, while we were in our room sleeping, the ceiling suddenly collapsed on us. The room's fan was bent, and as debris fell, my wife was injured with some scratches and a small injury to her head. Thankfully, we weren\u2019t more seriously hurt, but this incident left us shaken and traumatized. The hotel did offer us a refund and free meals, but after such a terrifying experience, we couldn\u2019t trust the safety of the place anymore.\n\nWe chose this hotel based on its appearance and amenities, but after the ceiling collapse, it was clear that the building was poorly maintained. It didn\u2019t seem safe, and the lack of guests staying there only added to our concerns. We immediately cut our trip short after the incident and decided to stay at another hotel.\n\nI would strongly advise anyone considering this hotel to look elsewhere. It was a terrifying experience that left us with lasting trauma, and it\u2019s not worth the risk to your safety.",

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and impeccable hospitality, setting the tone for an unforgettable experience.\n\nLet's start with the highlight of my stay: the food. The culinary delights offered at Hotel Rajasthan Palace were simply exquisite. Each meal was a culinary adventure, showcasing the rich flavors and traditional recipes of Rajasthan. From the aromatic spices in their curries to the mouthwatering desserts, every dish was a true gastronomic masterpiece. The menu catered to a variety of palates, ensuring that there was something to satisfy every craving. I particularly recommend trying their signature Rajasthani thali, a delightful assortment of regional specialties that left me craving for more.\n\nThe ambience of the hotel deserves special mention. The decor exuded elegance and charm, reflecting the cultural heritage of Rajasthan. The attention to detail was remarkable, from the intricately designed furnishings to the beautiful artwork adorning the walls. Whether it was the serene courtyard or the cozy restaurant, every corner of the hotel exuded a sense of tranquility and sophistication. It provided the perfect ambiance for relaxation after a long day of exploring the vibrant city.\n\nWhat truly set Hotel Rajasthan Palace apart was the exceptional service provided by the staff. The team went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my stay was flawless. They were attentive, friendly, and always ready to assist with any request. The staff's extensive knowledge about the local attractions and their helpful recommendations further enhanced my overall experience.\n\nI must also mention the comfortable and well-appointed rooms that provided a sanctuary of comfort during my stay. The attention to detail was evident in the thoughtful amenities and the plush bedding, ensuring a restful night's sleep. Waking up to a breathtaking view of the city skyline was an added bonus.\n\nThe hotel's location was another advantage, situated conveniently close to major attractions and landmarks. It allowed me to explore the city with ease, while also providing a peaceful retreat away from the bustling streets.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience at Hotel Rajasthan Palace was nothing short of exceptional. The delicious food, captivating ambience, and impeccable service made my stay truly memorable. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a truly immersive and delightful experience during their visit to Jaipur. I am already looking forward to my next stay at Hotel Rajasthan Palace, eager to indulge in their culinary treasures once again.",

Having looked at some of the other heritage style resorts, which seemed pretty good, but since reviews mentioned rooms/property were not in line with what they had seen in pics, we explored a bit more and came across this place in the last moment. Looking at the pics and reviews, we somehow liked this better than the others so decided to book this off. Really glad we did!\n\nThe whole property is beautiful, with a nice royal heritage touch throughout. On the day of check in, they were courteous enough to let's check in a couple of hrs early, felt good since we wanted to rest a bit before getting on with our touristy activities :)\n\nWhen we entered the royal suite that we had reserved, we were pleasantly surprised with the neatness of the room and the beautiful heritage look it had throughout!And it was huugeeee! Probably the biggest room we have stayed in so far!  The bed, the sofa, chairs, ceiling, the sit out area adjacent to windows with a view of the swimming pool, everything accentuated the look and feel of the room.\n\nComing to common areas in the property, each floor has been given a beautiful heritage look, including the stairs where they have thoughtfully kept accessories to accentuate the look. We loved spending a bit of time at different spots taking pics \ud83d\ude03 A big shoutout to the management and staff here for their attention to keeping the property and rooms so neat and clean!\n\nThough initially we had planned to eat only once in their in house restaurant and eat out rest of the times, we ended up eating all our meals here except for the lunch on 2nd day when we were out visiting forts! Dining area on terrace has a simple yet beautiful look and feel. What drew us to it subsequently was the tasty lunch we had here, we didn't need to worry about where to eat next! They provided good service throughout, so that's a plus point. At night, they have a group playing local traditional songs accompanied by some dance performances, which was good to witness while we enjoyed our drinks and ate away yummy food :)\n\nI can say, without a doubt, that everything we experienced here in person was much better than what we had seen in pics!\n\nThe only drawback we experienced was, their buffet breakfast was not up to mark, especially the south indian items. But that was a minor thing for us considering how great everything else was!\n\nWould highly recommend for people wanting to stay in a heritage style property in Jaipur at a reasonable cost. This being located centrally, visiting market or other touristy spots was easier too.",

The spa service was also really good! My therapist Benu suggested me a really good massage for my backache. They also have a Hi tea called Dharohar- which includes traditional dances, henna tattoos and pottery! Definitely a really fun and beautiful experience with tea and snacks! The dinner at Mohan mahal was the most Royal and lavish experience ever! Its a all mirror interior with only candles lit everywhere! Typically this must be how kings use to dine! The food and the thali at mohan mahal were amazing too! I also tried their italian restaurant! I would highly recommend the ravioli and risotto. Overall 10/10 for this property",

First of all they don't have an elevator, but as our rooms were in the first floor it was ok for us. It's a very old property located little interior to the main city. The rooms and bathrooms were clean and spacious. They do have a balcony but it's not maintained properly, the chairs were full of dust and cigarette ashes were all over the balcony. The worst thing here is the food and service. As they said they have a roof top restaurant, we went there for dinner (one have to use the stairs to reach there) but even after waiting for 20 mins no one cared to attend us. The food is not at all tasty. They don't even provide complimentary mineral water bottles and everything is chargeable. No kettles available in the rooms. The owner seemed nice, but who will opt a hotel just by considering that.",

The room rent was Rs. 3,000/-.\n\nAll in all a very good experience.\n\nOnly issue we found was with the aged man managing the restaurant on the roof-top.

From the elegant ambiance to the exceptional food quality, everything reflected the premium standards you expect from a five-star hotel.\n\nThe restaurant interiors are beautifully designed \u2014 spacious seating, warm lighting, and a calm atmosphere that makes you feel instantly relaxed. The staff was extremely courteous, well-trained, and attentive throughout the meal. Right from greeting us at the entrance to helping us with menu recommendations, the service was flawless.\n\nComing to the food \u2014 we opted for the buffet, and it exceeded our expectations in every way. The spread was extensive, covering a variety of Indian, continental, and Asian dishes. The live counters added a fresh touch, especially the pasta and chaat stations. Every dish was well-prepared, presented beautifully, and rich in authentic flavors.\n\nThe desserts section was another highlight \u2014 with multiple options including cakes, Indian sweets, fresh fruits, and ice creams. The quality of ingredients was evident, and the hygiene standards were top-notch.\n\nFor those preferring \u00e0 la carte, the menu also offers a wide variety of gourmet dishes, and the chefs are happy to customize spice levels based on your taste.\n\nWhether you're planning a family dinner, a business lunch, or even a special date night \u2014 the restaurant at Radisson Blu Jaipur is an excellent choice. The pricing is reasonable for the quality and experience offered. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy a fine-dining experience in Jaipur.",

Right from greeting us at the entrance to helping us with menu recommendations, the service was flawless.\n\nComing to the food \u2014 we opted for the buffet, and it exceeded our expectations in every way. The spread was extensive, covering a variety of Indian, continental, and Asian dishes. The live counters added a fresh touch, especially the pasta and chaat stations. Every dish was well-prepared, presented beautifully, and rich in authentic flavors.\n\nThe desserts section was another highlight \u2014 with multiple options including cakes, Indian sweets, fresh fruits, and ice creams. The quality of ingredients was evident, and the hygiene standards were top-notch.\n\nFor those preferring \u00e0 la carte, the menu also offers a wide variety of gourmet dishes, and the chefs are happy to customize spice levels based on your taste.\n\nWhether you're planning a family dinner, a business lunch, or even a special date night \u2014 the restaurant at Radisson Blu Jaipur is an excellent choice. The pricing is reasonable for the quality and experience offered. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to enjoy a fine-dining experience in Jaipur.",
