I think it lacks these finer aspects of service. I felt the room had a strong room freshener smell and I was personally unable to sleep well ( felt either too hot or too warm in the room).

It was unhygienic and completely unacceptable.\n\nWhen we reported the bed bug issue to the hotel staff, despite showing clear evidence of the bites, they completely denied that the bed had bed bugs. Instead of properly addressing the issue, their \u201csolution\u201d was to swap the bed with another from a different room, which is beyond unacceptable!\n\nTo make things worse, the manager and receptionist were extremely rude and unhelpful, showing no concern for our situation. The manager dismissed our complaint, saying that in his many years there, they had never experienced bed bugs, yet my entire family was covered in bites! The only saving grace was a kind and understanding female staff, but unfortunately, that did not make up for the horrible experience we had.\n\nAvoid this hotel at all costs unless you want to deal with poor hygiene, bed bugs, dirty toilets, and rude staff.",

            "text": "I had a terrible experience at this hotel. The room was filthy, and worst of all, the bed was infested with bed bugs. My companions and I were bitten multiple times, leaving us with itchy and painful marks. We barely got any sleep because of the discomfort.\n\nThe toilet was disgusting, there was black mold on the door and at the bottom of the toilet, making it clear that cleanliness is not a priority at this hotel. It was unhygienic and completely unacceptable.\n\nWhen we reported the bed bug issue to the hotel staff, despite showing clear evidence of the bites, they completely denied that the bed had bed bugs. Instead of properly addressing the issue, their \u201csolution\u201d was to swap the bed with another from a different room, which is beyond unacceptable!\n\nTo make things worse, the manager and receptionist were extremely rude and unhelpful, showing no concern for our situation. The manager dismissed our complaint, saying that in his many years there, they had never experienced bed bugs, yet my entire family was covered in bites! The only saving grace was a kind and understanding female staff, but unfortunately, that did not make up for the horrible experience we had.\n\nAvoid this hotel at all costs unless you want to deal with poor hygiene, bed bugs, dirty toilets, and rude staff.",

Room cleaning doens't happen in my 3 day stay, it's possible that I wasn't in room that time but I was available a whole day and they didn't bother.\n\nDidn't even provided something to wipe your feet so room infront of bathroom. TV didn't work either for some reason. It wasn't faulty, just didn't opened. And the worst thing, wifi is complete shit of this hotel and you don't get much of phone network in room so you are stuck with shitty WiFi. Room was fine although I felt like sheets werent new but I could be wrong.\n\nI was told that I can check in at 10am but I still had to wait for 2 hours but it can just be a issue which happened that day. No extra charges or anything. AC worked fine and so did elevators. There's a restaurant near it so good wasn't an issue either. Wouldn't go there again on purpose though since bathroom was just too damn bad.\n\nAlso the water for some reason came really slow and it completely stopped once I was in bathroom. I mean...it comes down to bathroom again and again. You should actually see the bathroom taps, it looked like they were from last era lmao Also shower wasn't working either",

The staff were like zombies, you asked them to help they just stare blankly at you or are actually actively trying to be more unhelpful and just want you to get out the way.\n\nIn the end we demanded a full refund, this they gave  - great.

Please read completely before going!\n\nI visited Citrus Caf\u00e9 at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram with my fianc\u00e9e, expecting at least basic professionalism for the money they charge. Instead, it turned out to be the worst dining experience I\u2019ve ever had. A complete waste of time and patience.\n\nI ordered a Greek salad, clearly written in the menu with feta cheese. What arrived after one hour was a bowl of chunky, oversized vegetable pieces drowned in lemon juice, with paneer thrown on top instead of feta. No oregano, no olive oil , basically, it wasn\u2019t a Greek salad at all. The staff never bothered to tell us they didn\u2019t have feta. I had to ask the waitress why there was paneer, only for her to casually say, \u201cWe don\u2019t have feta, sir.\u201d No apology, no heads-up, nothing.\n\nThe basics are missing here. I asked for grilled peri peri chicken skewers with minimal oil and made it extremely clear that my medical condition doesn\u2019t permit me to eat oily food. What came out of the kitchen was deep fried, not grilled. So their \u201cgrilled\u201d skewers are a lie too. The staff just shrugged and said sorry. When I asked for the manager, nobody showed up. The kitchen staff came instead and claimed the manager was \u201cbusy\u201d.\n\nI also ordered two lime sodas. They never arrived. After wasting an entire hour waiting for just a salad and a wrongly cooked chicken, I told them I\u2019d pay for the pathetic salad and leave. They refused to even let me pay, acting guilty, but what\u2019s the point? Basic courtesy and competence are missing here.\n\nThis place claims to have a decent a la carte menu. The reality is they don\u2019t have half the ingredients, they don\u2019t tell you upfront, and they have zero training to handle basic customer requests.\n\nIf you value your time, money, tastebuds, and basic respect, do not step inside Citrus Caf\u00e9 at Lemon Tree, Ramapuram. It\u2019s run by incompetent staff, clueless chefs, and a manager who hides when there\u2019s a problem. For a brand like Lemon Tree, this level of service is embarrassing.\n\nNever going back. Strongly NOT recommended.",

Instead, we were given a cramped room with two queen beds, lacking the facilities we had paid for.\n\nTo make matters worse, the room was unclean, with dirty towels and a smelly toilet. The air conditioning was non-functional, which made our stay even more uncomfortable. When we approached the manager about the situation, we were told that the room we had booked had been given to another family. This is simply unacceptable. How can a hotel prioritize other guests over those who have made a reservation in advance?\n\nI am baffled by how this hotel has received a 4.7-star rating. My experience was far from satisfactory, and I question the reliability of Booking.com as a booking platform, as I have never encountered such issues with other sites during my travels.\n\nTraveling with individuals of varying ages, we felt poorly treated and discriminated against.

I regret to inform you that my experience did not meet the expected standards, and I feel it is important to address these concerns for future improvement.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to clarify that the property does not fully align with the standards typically associated with Four point properties. The accommodation appeared to lack the luxurious amenities and services commonly associated with such establishments.\n\nOne of the primary issues I encountered was the limited food options available on-site. Considering the INR 1000 charge( Outskirt area of Chennai), the offerings did not add significant value to the overall experience. It is crucial for guests to have a variety of choices, especially in a property aiming for a 3-4-star rating.\n\nAdditionally, the rooms were not as spacious as expected, particularly the restroom facilities. The lack of space, especially for individuals who are not of a slim build, made the experience uncomfortable and inconvenient.\n\nMoreover, the location of the property was less than desirable, situated on the outskirts of the city. This contributed to a sense of isolation and inconvenience, further detracting from the overall experience. The poor location, coupled with subpar service and food quality, failed to meet the expectations associated with a 3-4-star property.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe it is imperative to address these concerns promptly to enhance the overall guest experience. Improving the variety and quality of food options, ensuring spacious and comfortable accommodations, and considering the property's location are key areas that require attention.\n\nThank you for considering my feedback. I hope these points will assist in enhancing the quality of service and accommodations provided.",
