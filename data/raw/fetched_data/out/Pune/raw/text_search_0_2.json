The toilet rolls kept in the washroom were used, not even brand new.\nTv remote isn't there. You need to switch it on manually which wasn't informed to me earlier. Ac not working properly.\nThen comes their highlight - Buffet breakfast. So there was puri bhaji, upma, canned juice, cornflakes, bread butter jam. It all looked a little unhygienic. There staff there isn't welcoming and warm at all. They will put one plastic water bottle at your table during breakfast. Not even a glass with it. I could only have puri bhaji as I'm a vegan. Upma was not good at all. There were no fruits, no fresh juice which is very basic at any buffet breakfast.\nThere is no help in terms of luggage. No one is present during checkout. Young kids are chilling outside.\nThere are much much better options available in the same price. Plz don't book this hotel.\nTo the hotel - Plz list your hotel @ 1000 per day.

The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful amenities. I especially liked how the power outlets were conveniently placed and adaptable to international standards, which made things much easier as a traveler. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which is always a welcome detail after a long day.\n\nThe hotel is also very conveniently located, making it a great choice for both business and leisure.

            "text": "So, this wasn't my 1st stay at any hotel affiliated with FAB, even I'm staying in Fab Hotels since it's inception.\nBut this was the most ugliest experience of all, I can recall my experience in the below points:-\n\n1. Starting from the location of the hotel, I would really like to not recommend this hotel to any one, either it be couples, families or groups, because the location is way worse than you can ever imagine, you have to go through the slums, and if you're pretty rich with some big car like swift etc, you can't even reach the location with your car, you've to park it somewhere outside, which is not even safe.\n\n2.check in process- So, the hotel FabExpress DDPK Ajay Inn has recently started some 3 months ago, as informed by the front desk manager, and he wasn't looking happy with his job there too \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, which I can understand by his Management of the business. He took around 60- 70mins just for the check in and lead us to the room. Because he was unable to keep a count on his work force also, which is also really hilarious.\n3. Hotel is 3months old, so with the new infrastructure, they have no clue of how to run it, and let me assure you, the room size which you saw in the enticing and lavishing pics are not really real, all that is a dogma.\n\n4. Staff behaviour:- It was really hard to see any courtesy and mannerism in the staff, for which Fab chain is popular. Employees and staffs are not at well mannered, punctual or groomed.\nI stayed at this hotel for 4days, and they never even bothered to clean the facilities provided.\n\n5. Strictly , not recommended for the couples and families, because they don't even have kitchen facility so again and again you have to buy food from outside, which you can't eat in your room too, according to their ugly policy.\n\n6. According to their advertisement, they provide you the power backup for 24hours, believe me, it's all fake.\n\n7. As I've already mentioned that, this isn't my first stay at any fab, so with the standards and quality kept in mind, which i received from others, I would really appreciate if you do not go for this hotel, as you can even get far better than this, in Viman Nagar.\n\nThat's it guyz.

What impressed us more was how they genuinely helped us select the most suitable rooms, so we wouldn\u2019t end up spending unnecessarily.\n\nThey even advised us not to extend the room timing just to keep our luggage \u2014 instead, they offered to safely store our bags in one of their rooms free of cost so we could roam around Pune without worry. The room service was prompt and polite. The rooms were really beautiful and well-maintained, and they perfectly accommodated all 9 of us. Even though we had booked non-AC rooms, the ventilation was so good that the rooms remained pleasantly cool all night.\n\nAfter exploring Pune, they were kind enough to give us one room just to freshen up and change before our train arrived. That gesture meant a lot! Overall, it was a wonderful experience, especially considering how last-minute and urgent our need was. The hotel provided excellent rooms at very reasonable prices with great hospitality. Highly recommended!",

            "text": "The hotel needs serious pest control, and rooms need maintenance, although the size of a standard room is decent for a solo traveller. Toilet seats need urgent renewal. These all can be done easily with a little surveillance by Treebo hospitality chain which has taken over it. Just taking over a property doesn\u2019t end your job. Breakfast should have more options and honestly they shouldn\u2019t charge extra for eggs in a breakfast menu, it was ridiculous.  One of the few advantages of this hotel is it's location and second, it\u2019s woman- friendly vibe. Good availability of nearby food joints, the locality is clean and safe, there is a shopping mall and a rooftop bar in walking distance. Chaturshringi Devi Temple is worth a visit for its view of the city from the hill.  Overall, it's good if you have some other work in the city, staying out all day and coming back to hotel past evening and have a good sleep. Hot water available 24*7. They provide electric kettle, mosquito repellents and toiletries on demand.  And beds are comfortable, not at all full of bed bugs contrary to some reviews. But there are cockroaches who are happily residing in the rooms, fortunately in my case, they didn't come up on the bed, or even if they have had, I was asleep and ignorant about it. There is a cat which meows in the night along the corridor, gives some thrill anyways.\nIn my opinion, charge 500/- less per day, if you are in no mind to improve the room maintenance and breakfast options. The staff behaviour was good, prompt, polite and friendly. Thumbs up for them.",

            "text": "Disappointed by the Misleading Standards and Unprofessional Conduct\n\nI had a very disappointing experience at Recedency Club, Pune \u2014 a property that falsely projects itself as a premium establishment charging five-star rates, but fails miserably when it comes to basic hygiene and customer service.\n\nDuring my earlier stay, I encountered bed bugs in the room, which was both shocking and unacceptable for a place that charges such high prices. I shared my honest review online, only to be personally requested by Ms. Carol at the reception to remove it, with the assurance that pest control measures would be taken immediately and such issues would not happen again.

The bed was big and comfortable, too. AC and fan were working fine, but the lights were not all working. There was one small mirror in the room where you can just see your face, but no dresser. There was another slightly bigger mirror in the bathroom above the basin. The whole room stank of some kind of spirit or paint thinner and my belongings all started smelling of the same thing by the second day. It was difficult to sleep because of that constant smell. Opening the windows was possible, but the windows did not have any bars, so I did not feel safe doing that. There was a set of very old and expired set of coffee, sugar, milk packets, which had ants all over them. I did not try and find out if the kettle worked. They did provide soap and towels, but no toothpaste. Hot water came only after draining the pipes of about two buckets of water, so to shower, I had to make sure I had the time to drain enough water (which I mostly reused for flushing the toilet) and wasn't in a hurry. The toilet flush worked fine, btw. The bathroom was also quite huge. As for food, there is a breakfast buffet which is supposed to be included with your stay, but I was charged for the first day, because apparently I reached before check-in time and had the breakfast which was supposed to be for the \"previous day\", even though I checked out at night and didn't need the breakfast of the \"next day\", which I would have assumed to compensate for my first day's breakfast. But I was charged anyway. My room was not cleaned during my stay, but I'm not sure if they would clean it if I asked them to (I didn't ask). Overall, it wasn't uncomfortable per se, but I would expect better hygiene from a hotel like this.",

Both our children enjoyed the place and wanted to extend their stay but sadly we couldn't.\n\nHighly recommend even if you are from Pune and want to have some peaceful time even in the city !",
