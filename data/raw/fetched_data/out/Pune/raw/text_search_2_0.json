As a Diamond member I was upgraded to an executive room, which was appreciated, although I had hoped for a suite to truly experience the full Conrad touch. Unlike my experience at the Conrad Bengaluru, there was no welcome note waiting in the room, no small treats or snacks, and the upgrade felt more standard than special.\n\nBreakfast was lively and at times quite busy, but the quality of the food was very good and worth the wait. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful amenities. I especially liked how the power outlets were conveniently placed and adaptable to international standards, which made things much easier as a traveler. The water pressure in the shower was excellent, which is always a welcome detail after a long day.\n\nThe hotel is also very conveniently located, making it a great choice for both business and leisure. Overall it was a pleasant stay, but I left wishing there had been a few more of those signature touches that usually set Conrad apart.",

Celebrating our anniversary, we were simply looking for a relaxing staycation to unwind and enjoy each other's company.\n\nFor the most part, our experience was indeed lovely. The hotel undeniably possesses the hallmarks of a five-star establishment. The food and drinks were a definite highlight, and we particularly enjoyed the extensive breakfast buffet. However, if you're planning a longer stay like ours, be aware that the buffet options might become a tad repetitive. The hotel also boasts excellent amenities, including a spa that we thoroughly enjoyed. Our balcony room was comfortable, featuring an exceptionally comfortable bed and prompt service whenever we requested it. The staff across the hotel were consistently polite and courteous.\n\nHowever, our stay was unfortunately punctuated by a series of unexpected hiccups that left us somewhat surprised, especially given the hotel's reputation. On one occasion, I was quite taken aback to find a piece of glass in my food during the breakfast buffet. While the staff were quick to apologize and address the situation, it was certainly a concerning incident.\n\nMy wife's experience with the salon was also disappointing. Despite enquiring a day in advance about curly hair products for a hair spa, the salon was unable to accommodate her needs. Furthermore, one day our room was missed during the cleaning service, even after we had specifically requested it. On our final night, we requested room service to clean our room upon our return, only to find that while the bed was tidied, the rubbish, trays, and the balcony remained untouched.\n\nSpeaking of the balcony, while it was a nice addition to our room, it ultimately felt underwhelming. Furnished with just a simple table and chairs and offering no shade from the intense daytime sun, it was unusable during the day. In the evenings, the abundance of mosquitos made it equally uninviting. The view from our room was also just satisfactory, with nearby buildings obstructing the sunrise.\n\nDespite these issues, I must acknowledge the hotel's commendable service recovery efforts. The staff consistently apologized for each incident and genuinely tried their best to rectify the situations. This proactive approach to service was definitely appreciated.\n\nUltimately, our anniversary staycation at The Westin Koregaon Park was a blend of positive and negative experiences. While the hotel offers many of the luxuries and services one expects from a five-star establishment, the series of unfortunate incidents we encountered during our short stay was surprising. It leaves us questioning whether it was simply bad luck or if there are underlying inconsistencies. While we appreciated the good aspects like the food, the comfortable room, and the polite staff, and especially their attempts to make things right, the repeated issues did detract from the seamless and relaxing experience we had hoped for. The salon, in particular, could benefit from better-trained staff who are knowledgeable about all the services offered.",

It\u2019s located close to Aga Khan Palace, not too far from the airport or Phoenix Mall, which makes it convenient for work or quick errands. This is an older property compared to the newer Hyatt Pune Residences nearby, and that shows in the interiors. The rooms are spacious, but the dark wood d\u00e9cor makes them feel smaller and almost crampped. Still, they\u2019re well equipped with a study table, high back chairs and footstool, wardrobe, and a clean bathroom unit with shower and sink.\n\nThe pool area is nicely done and located next to their spa and salon. The salon is run by Arya, and I\u2019ve used it during work trips it\u2019s great to have those services available when you\u2019re short on time and need something basic for hair or skincare. They also have a Blue Tokai coffee counter in the lobby, which is a plus if you like good coffee and are coming from cities like Bangalore.\n\nThe food, however, is something I feel doesn\u2019t quite match up to five-star standards, not just at Hyatt but across many luxury hotels in Pune. That said, the Asian restaurant has a pleasant vibe\u2014especially at night when the water wall is lit up\u2014and the food is decent. One small touch I appreciated was at breakfast, where they placed a tiny glass bowl with a single fish on tables where people were dining alone. It was thoughtful and not something you see often.\n\nStaff is courteous and helpful. Check-in was smooth, and they were proactive in helping with things like flower arrangements when we needed them. Overall, it\u2019s a good property, especially for work trips, with a few thoughtful touches that stand out.",

            "text": "Deeply Disappointed - Unacceptable Hospitality at Amanora The Fern\n\nMy experience at Amanora The Fern was incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Across multiple incidents, the lack of professionalism and care from the staff was glaring and what's worse, no real action was taken, even after we brought everything to their attention.\n\nStarting with the food: we ordered breakfast twice, asking for fried eggs and toast. The first time, the bread was not toasted at all. The second time, it came burnt. I had also asked for a portion of mushrooms, which arrived soaked in water, making them completely inedible. The tea was cold both times, we ended up not touching the food at all.\n\nLater that night, we ordered a brownie and confirmed with the chef that it contained no nuts, as I have a nut allergy. He assured us it didn\u2019t. But when the brownie arrived, it was filled with nuts. I had an allergic reaction and had to take medication in the middle of the night. This level of carelessness is unacceptable and honestly dangerous.\n\nThe worst, however, was the blatant violation of privacy. Despite the Do Not Disturb sign being on, the staff kept knocking, ringing the bell and even entered the room while I was inside alone and in the washroom. This is absolutely unacceptable behaviour.\n\nTo top it off, the next morning at 8 a.m the housekeeping woke us up by knocking and ringing the bell again, saying it was checkout time. Our checkout wasn\u2019t due yet and they later admitted it was a mistake meant for another room.\n\nEven after all of these incidents not a single manager checked in with us. No one attempted to take responsibility or offer any kind of gesture not even a complimentary item, discount or genuine effort to fix things. Just a casual \u201csorry\u201d during checkout, as if all of this was normal.\n\nI find this level of service shocking from a hotel under The Fern brand. The staff clearly lacks training, professionalism and basic courtesy. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone. Completely unacceptable experience. Please save yourself the money and time!!!!!",

The service was impeccable, delivered with such genuine warmth and attentiveness that it felt like the staff were personally invested in making our moment unforgettable. They went above and beyond, surprising us with a bottle of chilled champagne and two elegant glasses as per our special request, and the beautifully decorated bed was a touching masterpiece that made our hearts skip a beat. Every interaction with the team was infused with kindness, transforming our stay into the perfect start to a new chapter.\n\nThe food was an absolute delight, elevating our experience to new heights. The chicken stroganoff was a creamy, savory triumph, perfectly balanced and bursting with flavor in every bite. The hot chocolate was a warm, indulgent hug in a mug, rich and comforting, exactly what we needed to cozy up our evening. The rasmalai was divine\u2014soft, spongy, and soaked in a delicately sweet saffron-infused milk that melted in our mouths. And the scoop of vanilla ice cream? Silky, classic, and the perfect sweet note to end our meal. Each dish was crafted with care, making every bite a celebration of taste and texture.\n\nOur room, with its stunning view of the vibrant boulevard, was the ideal backdrop to this unforgettable night. Amanora The Fern didn\u2019t just provide a stay; they created a memory we\u2019ll never let slip from our minds. To the exceptional team, thank you for your outstanding service, culinary brilliance, and for making our night so extraordinarily special.

There's a mini fridge, a nice bathroom with a great shower, and the view from the room was just beautiful. Although the room size is quite small but it's good. There are other packages which provide different rooms.\n\nBreakfast was complimentary and surprisingly good \u2014 plenty of options to choose from. The pool is a nice addition, but keep in mind it\u2019s open only until 7 PM. They also offer helpful amenities like laundry service, a weighing machine, and more.\n\nLocation-wise, it\u2019s spot on.

A 1-star rating is generous for this dump.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nWe walked into this supposed \"5-star\" resort expecting luxury, but what we got was a joke. No lobby? Are you kidding me? All the activities, pool, and restaurant are 200m away uphill, and don't even get me started on the lack of transportation services. What about seniors? Did you even think about them?\n\nThe food at the clubhouse restaurant was disgusting. We waited forever for a table, and when we finally got our food, it was a letdown. And don't even get me started on the swimming pool. We get there and they're telling us we need a cap, which nobody informed us about earlier. And of course, they've got a shop selling them for 200 bucks each. What a rip-off!\n\nBut the cherry on top was when our car got punctured during checkout. We asked the staff for help, and they couldn't care less. No emergency services, no nothing. We had to struggle to find a mechanic, and after 3 hours, we finally managed to get one. And guess what? The hotel staff took his number for \"future reference\". Unbelievable.\n\nAvoid this resort like the plague. The management clearly doesn't care about their guests.",

The ambiance was elegant and comfortable, providing a perfect setting for a relaxed team gathering.\n\nWe opted for the buffet lunch, which had a good spread of dishes. The food was delicious and well-presented, and everyone appreciated the variety available in the main course and desserts.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of areas for improvement. The vegetarian starter options were limited, and we would have appreciated a bit more variety for our vegetarian team members. Also, the refilling time for a few dishes was slightly slow, which caused a bit of a wait during peak lunch hour.\n\nThat said, the staff was courteous and responsive, and we enjoyed the overall experience. With a few small tweaks, it could be even better. Would still recommend for team lunches and group outings.",

The service was impeccable, delivered with such genuine warmth and attentiveness that it felt like the staff were personally invested in making our moment unforgettable. They went above and beyond, surprising us with a bottle of chilled champagne and two elegant glasses as per our special request, and the beautifully decorated bed was a touching masterpiece that made our hearts skip a beat. Every interaction with the team was infused with kindness, transforming our stay into the perfect start to a new chapter.\n\nThe food was an absolute delight, elevating our experience to new heights. The chicken stroganoff was a creamy, savory triumph, perfectly balanced and bursting with flavor in every bite. The hot chocolate was a warm, indulgent hug in a mug, rich and comforting, exactly what we needed to cozy up our evening. The rasmalai was divine\u2014soft, spongy, and soaked in a delicately sweet saffron-infused milk that melted in our mouths. And the scoop of vanilla ice cream? Silky, classic, and the perfect sweet note to end our meal. Each dish was crafted with care, making every bite a celebration of taste and texture.\n\nOur room, with its stunning view of the vibrant boulevard, was the ideal backdrop to this unforgettable night. Amanora The Fern didn\u2019t just provide a stay; they created a memory we\u2019ll never let slip from our minds. To the exceptional team, thank you for your outstanding service, culinary brilliance, and for making our night so extraordinarily special.

My recent stay there was nothing short of spectacular, marked by the seamless blend of luxury, culinary excellence, and exceptional service. The spacious rooms welcomed me with breathtaking views of the city skyline, creating a tranquil retreat away from the hustle and bustle below. Every corner of the room was thoughtfully designed, from the plush bedding to the modern amenities, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.\n\nThe experience began with the incredibly efficient front office team, whose professionalism and warm approach made check-in a breeze. My dining journey kicked off at Mosaic, a multi-cuisine outlet that truly lives up to its reputation. From Asian delicacies to classic European dishes and Indian favorites, every meal was a delightful explosion of flavors. The skilled chefs clearly know their craft, presenting each dish with finesse and a touch of creativity that made dining at Mosaic feel like a global culinary tour.\n\nEvviva Sky Lounge, perched high above the city, quickly became my favorite spot. The panoramic views combined with the latest music set the perfect backdrop for a relaxing evening. The bar staff were nothing short of magicians, crafting cocktails that were as visually stunning as they were delicious. The atmosphere was vibrant, yet intimate\u2014a rare balance that made Evviva feel like a hidden gem in the sky.\n\nThe food and beverage service team consistently impressed me with their attentiveness and deep knowledge of the menu, elevating the dining experience at every turn. It was clear that service excellence is a core value at Crowne Plaza, and it shines through in every interaction.\n\nI also had the opportunity to explore the hotel\u2019s banqueting facilities, which were elegantly designed and equipped to handle everything from intimate gatherings to large celebrations. The level of detail put into each event space reflected the hotel\u2019s commitment to quality, making it an ideal choice for any occasion.\n\nFor a bit of relaxation, the spa offered a much-needed escape. The therapists guided me through a rejuvenating experience that left me feeling refreshed and recharged. It\u2019s an oasis within the hotel, providing a perfect balance of tranquility and luxury. The fitness room, adjacent to the spa, was well-equipped and provided the perfect setting for a quick workout, allowing me to keep up with my fitness routine effortlessly.\n\nNavigating the hotel was made even smoother thanks to the quick and efficient valet and security staff, who were always on hand to assist with a level of service that was both courteous and professional.\n\nCrowne Plaza Pune is more than just a hotel\u2014it\u2019s a complete experience that caters to every need with style and grace. From the enchanting views and luxurious rooms to the top-notch dining and impeccable service, every aspect of my stay was thoughtfully curated, making it a place I\u2019ll eagerly return to whenever I\u2019m in Pune.\n\nThanks to the entire team. From expert and experienced GM to normal Bus Boy working for Crowne, each and everyone is there to make your visit unforgettable.\n\nManav Kaushik",

It is pretty well connected with Pune Airport and the railway station.\n\nThe hotel has a grand lobby, with one side having a ballroom and the other side having \"The Eatery, \" one of the 3 restaurants the hotel has. The buffet breakfast is served here only in the morning till 10.30 a.m. in the morning. The hotel has two lifts. Our room was located on the 8th floor, and the view from the top was splendid, facing the pool area.\n\nThe room in itself was luxurious and well maintained. It contained all the necessary amenities, including a steam iron and an ironing board, tea/coffee maker, etc. The lighting and furniture in the room were appropriate, and the beds and all were extremely comfortable.\n\nComing to the breakfast, it was a sumptuous spread of food from across the length and breadth of the country. Prominent items included Puri bhaji, Misal Pav, 2 -3 types of Idli, medu vada, potato wedges, grilled tomatoes, a variety of cakes, milkshakes, fruit juices, etc. I really loved the attitude of the restaurant staff. Kudos to Protima and Regina for the impeccable service they provided to us during our breakfast at the eatery on all 4 days. You should definitely have more such staff members.\n\nHowever, I have rated 4 stars due to a few significant reasons. First, the initial room that was assigned had a non-functional AC. It made living impossible in that room. And upon inquiring with the staff, they took more than 2 and half hours to change the room that too after 50 calls. And it was entirely the reception staff who delayed this thing. In the new room that we were shifted to though AC was functioning, the dim lights and one part of the wall lights were non-functional. Also, though the breakfast was great, it was repeated even in just 4 days. These 2 issues I faced were the primary reasons to rate overall 4 stars.\n\nBut the overall stay was great. The restaurant staff was impeccable in providing service, rooms were neat, clean, and luxurious. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel, Sheraton is definitely one place you should look into in Pune.",
