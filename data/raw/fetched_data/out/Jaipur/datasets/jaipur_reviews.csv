Though it was decent, for a hidden gem like this if it was more maintained it would have been like living in a palace literally. The breakfast options were limited but no complaints. I just think they could have banked on the opportunity that they had a palace property and the upkeep is everything. A must visit.

Family managed, the property is well maintained and offers value for money. The service is exceptional. I must specifically mention Vijay Sr. and Jr. The menu at the restaurant needs more attention, specially the breakfast and the portions served for the prices charged for the rest of the menu items.

jai002,jai002_r1,Pradeep Batra,5,"We had the pleasure of celebrating our anniversary at the magnificent Jai Mahal Palace in Jaipur on 20th May 2025 and it was truly an unforgettable experience.

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with a beautiful floral reception that set the tone for our entire stay. The warmth and hospitality extended to us throughout our visit made us feel genuinely special and completely at home.

Every member of the staff we interacted with was incredibly courteous and professional. Special thanks to the Front Office Manager and the wonderful team of ladies at the reception for their gracious assistance. We would also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Vikram, Mr. Aslam, and Chef Pradeep Thakur from the restaurant team — each one of them contributed to making our dining experience truly exceptional. The food was simply beyond our expectations — delicious, thoughtfully prepared, and served with great care.

We were also grateful for the flexibility shown with our early check-in and late check-out, which added to our comfort and convenience.

A heartfelt thank you to Mr. Rathore, the General Manager, for his thoughtful letter and warm anniversary wishes. It added a very personal touch to our stay.

It’s clear that the impeccable hospitality we experienced is a reflection of the Taj culture — one that prioritizes warmth, care, and excellence in every detail.

God bless you all, and thank you once again for making our anniversary so memorable.

Thank you

jai003,jai003_r1,Rupam Khetan,3,"Stayed at Ginger Jaipur for a night, and overall, it’s a decent budget option, but don’t expect too much beyond the basics.

Ambience: The ambience was okay, nothing special — functional and minimal, more in line with a business hotel. Clean, but a bit dull and could use a refresh.

Rooms: The rooms were very average — compact, with basic amenities. It’s fine for a short stay, but not something you’d choose for comfort or leisure. Maintenance could definitely be improved.

Food: Food was disappointing. Limited options, and the taste was quite bland. If you’re particular about your meals, you might prefer dining elsewhere.

Service: Service was decent — staff was polite and helpful, though not particularly warm or engaging.

Location: The best part is the location — well-connected and easy to access, especially if you’re traveling through the city or have work nearby.

Price: For the price, it’s a fair deal for a one-night stay, especially if you’re not looking for anything fancy.

Overall: A functional, budget-friendly stopover — ideal for a short or transit stay, but not recommended for a longer vacation or anyone looking for a more comfortable experience.",2025-04-20T06:57:10.777093Z,4 months ago

The standard room was compact but well-kept, with all the basic amenities needed for a comfortable visit. Housekeeping was prompt, and the front desk staff was helpful and responsive.

While the stay was enjoyable, there's always room for small improvements in ambiance or food options, but nothing that took away from the overall experience.

I would definitely recommend Ginger Jaipur to anyone looking for a budget-friendly and clean place to stay in the city, especially for short leisure or business trips.",2025-06-16T14:24:46.625045Z,2 months ago

The location was great, in a busy touristy area. I didn't pay much attention nor that I cared that much but it was an old heritage hotel. The room was ok. Excellent service from male receptionist and housekeeping staff.

jai004,jai004_r5,Kumar Sanju,1,"Rooms, services and location (center of city and near all tourist places) all are excellent. Very helpful staff. I had a pleasant stay. The helpful staff and service was only because I paid a unreasonably high amount.

But they overcharged. I paid Rs 3000 for 2 rooms for many days. But even the online vendors offer the rooms at lesser amount. And I went to him offline directly. But they actually billed more than real prices. This is just wrong. I later also found cheaper rooms empty in the same hotel but they refused to give me those.

I had old parents with me and I could not put them through much movement. So I continued. But as I found out the real prices and the empty available rooms I realised they completely took advantage of me. They did not even get me room with windows when I waited for days and those rooms were available but they kept saying they are booked even after paying this hefty sum.

You should avoid this hotel as an Indian because you cannot compete with the unreasonable amounts foreigners can pay. This hotel has 90% foreign travellers. If you still need to stay, you should not pay more than Rs 2000 for this property. This I am quoting when online portals even give this hotel at Rs 1600 for deluxe rooms. And from my own extensive travel experience in Rajasthan and India regularly.

I wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but this experience left me feeling cheated very badly.

And do not approach them for any cab service or any shopping help. They will point you to contacts that give them commision and hence those cabs or shops or services loot you.",2024-12-10T16:52:01.031972Z,9 months ago
jai005,jai005_r1,Deep's Chhipa,1,"Worst Hotel Experience – Do Not Book Hotel Meru Casa, Jaipur

Staying at Hotel Meru Casa was nothing short of a nightmare. I travel frequently and have stayed at many hotels, but this property is by far one of the worst I have ever experienced. Every single aspect of the stay was disappointing and frustrating.

Staff & Service: The staff here is shockingly rude, arrogant, and completely unprofessional. They lack even the most basic sense of hospitality. Instead of helping guests, they carry unnecessary ego and make the stay even more unpleasant.

Room Condition: The rooms are in horrible shape. Furniture is old, broken, and looks like it hasn’t been maintained for years. Nothing gives even the slightest feeling of comfort. Cleanliness is missing, and the overall condition of the rooms is depressing.

Bathroom Facilities: The bathroom was a disaster. The drainage system does not work properly, water collects on the floor, and the taps are so old and broken that they barely function. On top of that, there was no proper water supply. It felt unhygienic and unusable.

Amenities: The amenities provided are practically useless. The TV only runs a few news channels—no entertainment or variety at all. The AC makes such a loud and disturbing noise that sleeping becomes impossible. Even the mirror provided was so bad that you couldn’t even see your face clearly in it.

Overall Experience: This hotel is a complete waste of money and time. I didn’t even feel like staying in the room or sleeping because the environment was so frustrating and uncomfortable. There is absolutely no value for money here—just stress and disappointment.

Final Verdict:
Hotel Meru Casa is one of the worst hotels in Jaipur. With rude staff, terrible maintenance, unhygienic bathrooms, useless amenities, and zero hospitality, it should not even be listed as a proper hotel. I strongly warn anyone considering this place—do not book a room here under any circumstances. There are far better options in Jaipur at the same price or even lower.

jai005,jai005_r5,Kevin Fox,1,"Terrible experience. Dont trust the local guide reviews. There were blackouts the first night and I didn't have hot water for 2 days even after complaining to the staff. They also canceled our reservation an hour before arriving (and we'reinternational travelers), presumably to book someone else then the manager denied canceling our reservation despite an email saying that they had canceled on us. They also charge extra for water, which is ridiculous. The heat does not work in the room either. The breakfast buffet has 3-4 dishes and it's not very good. When we had dinner he told us not to talk about the price too loudly (I guess he was charging more for other groups?) Super shady.

When we requested a spare room for just **5 minutes** since we were four women and needed some privacy, she showed absolutely no empathy and refused in the most insensitive way possible.

The attitude of this woman is beyond rude and arrogant. She behaves as if she’s some kind of queen, completely detached from the concept of basic hospitality.

Dining at the hotel’s signature restaurant, Azure, was an experience in itself. Every dish was artfully presented and bursting with flavor. The staff were knowledgeable, attentive without being intrusive, and remembered my preferences after just one visit.

The spa deserves a special mention — a true sanctuary. I booked a 90-minute massage and left feeling completely renewed. The relaxation lounge, herbal teas, and serene ambiance were exactly what I needed to unwind.

What truly sets Grand Haven apart, though, is the attention to detail. From turndown service with lavender-scented linens to personalized notes from housekeeping, every gesture made me feel valued and cared for.

Final Verdict:
If you’re looking for a luxury escape with world-class service, breathtaking views, and unmatched comfort, The Grand Haven Resort & Spa is simply unbeatable. I can’t wait to return.

Note:- There is extra fir train pickup service and bus station pickup!",2025-08-03T11:48:12.349484180Z,a month ago

We enjoyed the pool, even though pigeons that live everywhere around the city does not make it easy for the hotelier to clean the rooftop area.
Dinner ordered to the room was tasty and beer at the bar refreshing. Till 6 pm you can enjoy happy hour 2 for 1. Also, we have been pleased with the laundry service and hotel staff overall.

Rooms were clean, modern, and spacious, with everything you'd expect. No complaints there. The rooftop pool and bar area were surprisingly peaceful. Not too crowded and a great spot to unwind.

Breakfast was decent, good Indian variety, but continental lovers might find it a bit limited. Also, restaurant service was a tad slow during peak hours, but the staff were polite and doing their best.

Not ultra luxury, but a solid, reliable place with professional service and good value for the price. I’d pick it again for a comfortable city stay without fuss.",2025-06-17T10:13:51.597268457Z,2 months ago

To start with, it was the best hotel service we experienced for a long long time, not only in India, but globally! Shivya, the owner and host, is super nice and extremely caring.

The hotel is beautifully and tastefully designed, with attention to every small detail. We stayed at the Stallion room, which is one of their 4 rooms (they are now building 4 additional rooms), which was spacious, comfortable, and more importantly very clean, with a large shower and hot water all day long.

The only problem with the room is that it lacks privacy, since it is situated right next to the dining area. But this is soon going to change, as they are expanding and building a new restaurant.

The rest of the staff is also great. The house chef is awesome, and he can make almost anything you like in short notice, both Indian and international, and it all tasted gooooood!",2025-02-09T11:41:13.966408Z,7 months ago

But as soon as we reached, we had to carry our luggage ourselves to the reception because there was no bell boy available to help. We checked in a room but the curtains there were torn, so they shifted us to another room. As soon as we entered the another room, the room was so small that even our luggage bag could not be opened. The balcony was also very small. When we complained at the reception that these were not the category of rooms that we had booked, the receptionist said that this is heritage property and all the rooms here are same. The pictures on the internet are just for reference. We were very surprised but they ignored us. The tea bags provided in the rooms were also open and not in proper packaging, which is below standard for a heritage property. When we tried to turn on the TV, we found out that the set top box was faulty. The housekeeping staff tried to fix the TV for half an hour but finally said sorry and left. Then our wifi was also not working so we complained to the reception twice but still we did not get any help.

The whole place has a royal Rajasthani style, like an old palace, with carved balconies and a rooftop restaurant. Staying here felt like traveling back in time… almost like being royalty!

The hotel breakfast was also great, with many tasty options. The staff were very kind and welcoming. If you ever visit Jaipur, you should definitely stay here for a night—or even a few nights. You won’t regret it :)",2025-04-14T13:32:48.979326Z,4 months ago

jai022,jai022_r2,SMIT THAKKAR,2,"This review is based on our recent 3 night stay at the hotel. Overall ambiance of the room was good. However, there was lack of basic hospitality in terms of drinking bislery water, basic toiletries, lack of hooks & hangers, limited ventilation and absence of complimentary services with strict rules for each and every thing. Not worthy for a premium room rent of more than 3k per night.",2025-08-24T05:28:16.041367413Z,2 weeks ago
jai022,jai022_r3,abhinav malhotra,1,"I booked this place expecting a *luxury boutique hotel* experience, but unfortunately, it was anything but that. The property felt shady from the moment I entered. The rooms were poorly maintained, with a constant unpleasant smell that made the stay very uncomfortable. Cleanliness and hygiene were a big concern; the bathrooms and linens did not feel properly cleaned, which is unacceptable for any hotel, let alone one that markets itself as “luxury.”

What made things worse was the staff. Instead of being courteous and helpful, they were uncooperative and dismissive of even basic requests. Hospitality was completely missing, which is surprising in a city like Jaipur that is otherwise known for its warmth and service.

Overall, this hotel is *far from* what it claims to be. If you’re looking for comfort, hygiene, and good service, I’d strongly recommend looking at other options in Jaipur. This place was a huge disappointment and not worth the money.",2025-08-20T11:30:55.644044827Z,2 weeks ago

However, a few areas need improvement. The breakfast buffet was average, and the baked items such as croissants and donuts were below par. Our experience with the spa was also disappointing. Despite receiving a call from the spa, there was no male masseuse available in the evening. When we tried to book a session for my wife the following morning, we were told that no female masseuse would be available during those hours either, which was quite frustrating.

The valet service also requires attention. The staff often appeared disengaged instead of being attentive to guests.

On a positive note, the reception team was excellent — professional, courteous, and always ready help.

This was extremely disappointing, especially considering the standard the property claims to uphold.

Even for small requests like cold drinking water, the response is painfully slow. Simple things that should have taken a few minutes stretched endlessly, making our stay frustrating.

The staff is humble and polite, and I appreciate that, but hospitality is not just about good manners; it’s about fulfilling basic guest needs promptly and efficiently, which this property failed to do repeatedly during our stay.

1. Spider web on the washroom wall.
2. Curtains along with curtain rod fall on me as soon as I touched the curtain to check what’s behind.
3. Any guesses what’s behind? An open window - very dirty outside of that area. Washroom exhaust open area, very pungent smell.
4. Zero in hospitality.
5. Urine spots and hair on toilet seat.

When we asked at the reception- reason for the leftover spider web - he is like “Reh gaya hoga na”
When asked him to fix the curtain - he is like “ye kaise gira dia aapne” we were like hamne gira dia..! Wtf.
When asked why the window was open - answer was - “aapne he kholi hogi”

When asked why the area outside window isn’t clean - answer- “wo to bahr hai na sir”

This was by far the worst hotel experience I’ve ever had. If you’re traveling with family, especially with kids – stay away from this place.

We were just 25 minutes late for checkout, and charged us 1500₹ extra for that half an hour. We politely explained that we had a young child with us. Instead of showing any understanding or basic decency, the management started shouting at us. It was completely uncalled for and extremely unprofessional.

When we started recording the situation (which we had every right to do), the staff tried to snatch our phones — an outrageous and aggressive act. Is this how guests are treated here?

Overall, the staff is rude, the management is money-minded and aggressive, and there is no sense of hospitality or customer respect. Charging ₹1500 for a 25-minute delay with a child, shouting at guests, and attempting to take their phones — that says everything about how this hotel is run.

Rating: 1/5

I recently had the misfortune of staying at the Sawai Man Mahal in Jaipur, a hotel that boasts of being a 5-star property. Unfortunately, the staff's behavior and service were far from what one would expect from a luxury hotel.

From the moment we arrived, the staff seemed completely disinterested in greeting us or helping us with our luggage.
Person who assisted us was Devender and Ashutosh. The check-in process was slow and cumbersome, and the staff seemed put off by our presence.

Throughout our stay, we encountered numerous instances of rude and unhelpful behavior from the staff. They seemed more interested in chatting with each other than attending to our needs or addressing our concerns (Rajveer in Breakfast Area)

The lack of enthusiasm and warmth from the staff made our stay feel unwelcome and unenjoyable. For a hotel that claims to be a 5-star property, the service was shockingly subpar.

Unless the management takes serious steps to address these issues and train their staff to provide better service, I would not recommend Sawai Man Mahal to anyone.

*Room Tip:* Avoid this hotel until they improve their staff's behavior and service.

jai030,jai030_r3,Sai Allanki,5,"Sawai Man Mahal is one of Jaipur’s most elegant heritage palaces, reflecting the grandeur and royal lifestyle of the Rajput kings. Built by Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II in the early 20th century, the palace was originally part of the City Palace complex and served as the royal residence. Today, it stands as a fine example of Jaipur’s regal legacy, seamlessly blending Rajput architectural traditions with subtle European influences.

The palace boasts spacious courtyards, intricately designed archways, and beautifully decorated interiors that reflect the refinement of Jaipur’s royal era. Its grand halls and galleries, adorned with traditional motifs and artworks, evoke the splendor of a time when Jaipur was a flourishing cultural and political center. Over the years, Sawai Man Mahal has hosted royal gatherings, state functions, and important visitors, carrying forward its legacy of hospitality and grace.

What makes Sawai Man Mahal truly special is its ability to transport visitors into a world of timeless beauty.

jai031,jai031_r5,Robert Moore,3,"Pros:  location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping in Jaipur.  Their in house tour concierge was helpful in arranging a very good 8 hour car/driver to see the sights of Jaipur.  The breakfast was included and was pretty good; we ate there each day.  They have a bar available, although it doesn’t seem too busy.  They have room service and the food was good. The external appearance and lobby area are nice, and the doorman/reception staff and restaurant/bar staff were all attentive, and polite, providing excellent service.

Issues:  The staff doing the room cleaning needed to be reminded to clean the rooms (recommend being very clear) and did a rather rapid/not thorough room cleaning, with variable restocking of items.  When room service trays were left in the hall, they were left all night; the night staff should do rounds and clear the halls of such items, not leaving to the daytime cleaning crew which seemed to arrive around 11 am or noon or so.  Used the laundry service, which was slower than others used in India (took almost 48 hours).

jai033,jai033_r1,Kunal Singh,1,"Disappointing Experience at Chirmi Palace Café, Jaipur

I recently visited Chirmi Palace Café, Jaipur with high expectations, but unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing. Right from the beginning, the service failed to meet even basic hospitality standards.

I had ordered a cold coffee, which was shockingly served in a broken glass. When I pointed this out to the staff, instead of preparing a fresh one or even straining it, they simply poured the same drink into another glass, which is not only unprofessional but also unhygienic. Such negligence in service is unacceptable, especially when you’re charging premium prices from guests.

We also ordered pasta, which turned out to be excessively sweet, making it far from enjoyable. The taste and quality of the food were truly disappointing — far below what one would expect from a café in this price range.

The only redeeming aspect of the café was its quiet and pleasant ambience, but that alone cannot make up for poor food quality and lackluster service. Overall, it was a horrible experience, and I sincerely hope the management takes guest feedback seriously and works on improving both hospitality and food standards.

Very disappointed with the mouldy bathroom. Broken tap and water everywhere from the shower. Had to request cleaning on 2nd day. Then had to ask them to restock towels, soaps etc. T.V. wouldn't turn on. Had to have someone come to the room to help, twice! There was no information about the area.
Breakfast was meagre, cold and not refilled fast enough. We had to ask constantly for hot water, tea/coffee. Very understaffed.",2025-02-09T11:06:33.386533Z,7 months ago

The food at the hotel was also commendable, with a wide range of options to cater to different tastes and preferences.

What truly stood out, however, was the staff's dedication to providing outstanding customer service. Their warm hospitality, attention to detail, and willingness to go the extra mile made our stay truly memorable.

I would highly recommend Treebo Natraj Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable stay. The hotel's commitment to excellence is evident in every aspect of its operations, and I have no hesitation in rating it 5/5 stars.

jai041,jai041_r5,Zahir Abbas Nimbalkar,4,"We recently traveled to Jaipur and chose to stay at the Treebo Hotel chain, specifically the Treebo Natraj Hotel. The hotel is conveniently located near the railway station, which was a plus for us. The hotel rooms were clean; however, I would suggest that they keep room fresheners inside the rooms for a better ambiance.

We did encounter an issue with the water geyser, which was malfunctioning. Unfortunately, this necessitated a room switch, and we were not provided with any assistance during the process. Additionally, the second room had a short circuit issue with the bathroom switch, which was quite inconvenient.

On a positive note, the complimentary breakfast options were good, though they could offer a bit more variety.

It’s important to mention that the location is surrounded by local and outstation transportation by bus and parcel services. Please choose wisely if this might be a concern for you.",2025-02-26T04:04:57.959117Z,6 months ago

They made sure that we were fed well and the food served was of good quality, freshly made and healthy. The rooms are traditional and beautiful (we were staying in the deluxe suites on the ground floor).

The only 2 small/minor cons were that the location of the hotel was a little inside a residential area away from the main road and one of our bathrooms didn't have any exhaust which added a little discomfort.

Pro’s :
1) a little outside the city. If you want to stay away from city then its good.
2) Rooms: clean and all services are provided. Overall very good.
3 ) Decent parking space
4) buffet breakfast taste.
5) open sitting on terrace

Can be improved :
1) Adding a ‘Net’ on windows.
2) special arrangement can be done above rooftop. Its not utilized.
3) Rooms are little small.
4) place does not justifies the price. Amount can be reduced by 20% so it would be a good value to money option.
5) please dont use, cloth to cover sandwich in buffet. It looks bad and a little unhygienic.

We stayed here for 2 days and hotel staff was so friendly, they allowed us to check in early and check out late without any additional cost.

This hotel has also small restaurant and provide room service again with no charges. This may not be the ideal choice for elders and families but will definitely recommend to couples. Location was supremely easy to reach and places like Amer Fort and Hawa Mahal are nearby.
Apart from small amenities as I mentioned above, all was great and remember folks, hotels should not be compared with homes and you should consider the price you are paying if such small facilities are not available.

jai051,jai051_r2,Stephan Wiederkehr,2,"The location is quite brilliant. Most of the staff was perfectly nice and helpful. However, the rooms are quite old and are not very well maintained. I saw two of them, where both where in similar condition, e.g. fungus in the bathroom. The bedsheets are often stained. I had to ask the staff to change them and it took them several attempts to find clean sheets. The food is great, but the atmosphere is not particularly appealing.
The hotel serves as a decent place to stay, but it has nothing to do with a 5 star hotel, let alone luxury. Having said that you are probably better off with a significantly cheaper option.",2019-03-19T12:41:58.923227Z,6 years ago

It is more of a business hotel but for a short stay for families it works welj. The view from the window is not that great & the same applies to the entrance. Staffs are friendly and co operative.

Menu :- different for different days

Only advice to management is to consider more starters option.
As personally I dont like pasta and rolls, (these r only 2 veg starters available here) so may be you. An consider something else so that person who doesn't eat these items can eat something else.

We had a very pleasant stay here. The service was excellent — the staff were kind, responsive, and went out of their way to make us comfortable. The food was absolutely amazing — fresh, flavourful, and definitely a highlight of our time here.

The room was clean, the bathroom had no unpleasant smells, and everything felt well maintained. On one of the days, the water was only lukewarm, but otherwise everything worked fine. The hotel was generally quiet — and having the air conditioning on helped block any outside noise, making it easy to sleep.

In one room, the flush tank for the commode was not working, and in the other, the jet spray was not functional. Additionally, in one of the washrooms, the shower head and tap were also not fully functional, which was quite inconvenient.

The staff was just okay, nothing exceptional. Another issue was with the check-in process. I had booked through Yatra.com, where it clearly mentioned the check-in time as 1:00 PM. However, when we reached, the hotel staff said the check-in time was 2:00 PM. After multiple follow-ups, they finally allowed us to check in at 1:45 PM, which was frustrating.

jai055,jai055_r3,Nehal Singh,1,"Update:  If you think guests arrive at your hotel have 1 hour to drama without any reason, it suits you. Yes, we got angry but that’s because your team was trying to fraud us. You keep your work culture and we will keep our business away. They say the fish rots from the head and fits well in the context.

My brother recently left a review, and I’d like to add a few points in the spirit of constructive feedback to help improve future guest experiences. We visited Nahar Singh yesterday with the genuine intention of supporting a local establishment. Unfortunately, our experience fell short of expectations, particularly with the customer service.

As echoed in many 1-star reviews, the front-desk experience was disappointing. While we understand that service limitations can occur, the way they’re communicated makes all the difference. A simple smile and a courteous explanation would have gone a long way. Unfortunately, the receptionist’s attitude left us feeling unwelcome, and we ultimately chose not to stay despite already having paid.

We took our business to a nearby international brand, not because we wanted to, but because we felt we had no other choice. This experience served as a learning moment for us as well, as we strive to avoid similar missteps in our own choices.

To future guests: please make your decision carefully. And to the management, investing in basic customer service training can go a long way in turning around perceptions and experiences. We truly hope this feedback is taken in the spirit intended.

So sorrily disappointed, but hopeful for improvement.",2025-07-02T03:54:22.096071931Z,2 months ago
jai055,jai055_r4,Upasna Sharma,1,"Nahar Singh haveli is located 46, Kanti Nagar, Sindhi Camp. You can reached there only by the walking of 10 minutes from Sindhi Camp. If we talk about the structure of Haveli , its infrastructure is like king palace in old times with morden touch . Apart from all this , we reached there near about 7 am  and had booking issue but after sorting all that we pay extra 500 for early morning Check In ( total 1360 +500) with all facilities like geyser, AC etc .Even after paying so much for 3 days they did not allow us to  use the AC and the money was for the AC room, if it was like this then before making the payment they would have said that prior he is giving an AC room but  you are not able to use AC . It was like, Give the money for the AC and sleep under the fans, it would have been better if we took a non AC room. We thought, it doesn't matter, maybe it won't get so hot, so if the AC doesn't work, it doesn't matter. But it was so hot during the day that it was very uncomfortable without AC. Me and My husband felt very bad, We spent money on AC room and had to sleep in such heat, it would be better if I take a room somewhere else . And when I asked him at the reception to turn on the AC saying that it is feeling hot so turn it on, he said he will not turn on room's before AC service. Moving further, one day before Check Out , we heard the room next door to our room Ac was turned On . I confirmed the room lady And she said us yes one of my Room ac is working. Me again went to the reception and told him that the AC of the adjacent room is working then why not ours, then he asked where is it working, then without arguing he quickly started ours also and for so  service and then by mistake the AC of the adjacent room was left on, so to hide his mistake he switched ours on too. Another worst part is this, He turned on the AC on but after half an hour he turned it off too.Then at night when we asked him to switch on the AC again, he said the AC will not turn on. Take the owner's card and talk to the owner. Look , how rude it is. Like , then why you charging for ac room if you not provide that facility to customers. ( Now the owner will reply for this comment You got such a nice room in so little money, what else do you want? ) But let me clear, even before booking I was sure that their best room is for Rs 1360 , even I also confirmed on phone call . No Doubt room and washroom was neat and clean more than expected. But my overall experience at this hotel was not so good because only neat and clean room, washroom is not enough expect other facilities too .

jai056,jai056_r1,Ishank Chandra,2,"No accountability or assurance of any service. No separate calling lines for reception or room service. The different buttons for the same do not work. When you call them for something, they say they are going to do it, but never get it completed. A couple of instances, I called them for dental kit (which ideally should already be placed in the washroom), the person said he's sending it, but no one ever came. Another time, I called to ask them why wifi user name and password are not working. He said it's a server backend issue, should resolve over night. Anyways, there was very poor network connectivity for Airtel and VI inside the hotel room plus this wifi issue. I thought it's okay it can happen with any wifi provider. The next morning I had to do some high bandwidth work at 8 am. I literally thought by then the wifi issue would have got resolved, but it didn't. I tried using my mobile's data, but it failed. Irritated me called the reception again wondering why the wifi issue is still not resolved. The lady this time at the reception told it's not a wifi issue, your password is expired because it has lost its validity. The person a night ago told me incorrectly that it's a wifi server issue, this time I'm told it's an invalid password issue. First of all, the services should be valid for the entire duration from check-in till check-out and cannot get expired or invalid prior to that, that too when the entire stay is already fully paid prior to check-in. Secondly, no accountability of the people sitting at reception who are supposed to resolve these kind of issues. They just want it to let go off, irrespective of whether or not the problem is solved, that's such a waste. No one responding to the requests (dental kit), no one trying to solve an issue caused by their own end (wifi password expiry). Apart from these issues as well, the hotel boasts about parking. On that, the roadside unsafe parking is provided. Now who is responsible for overnight parking of the car outside the hotel premises, everyone knows - literallly no one. In short, the services of this hotel are not at all worthy of a 4+ star rating this has right now,  these ratings and reviews seem to be fake honestly. This is no more than an okayish 3 star property.

jai056,jai056_r2,manojhajeley,1,"One of the Worst Hotel Experiences – Avoid if You Can!

I had a very disappointing stay at Vesta Maurya Hotel. Right from the moment I checked in, the experience was below average. The fan in the room was not working properly – the regulator was faulty and despite multiple complaints, no one came to fix it. The room remained uncomfortable throughout my stay.

What made things worse was the poor service. Basic requests took forever to be addressed, and the staff seemed either disinterested or overwhelmed. There's clearly a lack of proper management or training.

The worst part, however, was the rude and unprofessional behavior of the front office staff. Instead of being helpful or apologetic, they were dismissive and even borderline arrogant when I tried to raise my concerns. It's honestly shocking how such poor customer service exists in a hotel that claims to be reputable. The behaviour and callousness can be evidenced that the front office staff claimed that they had very few rooms with fans so either you take it or leave it. For a 3 member stay they have no provision for giving the third towel and glass in the room.

I would strongly advise against staying at Vesta Maurya Hotel. There are far better options around with more respectful staff and proper room maintenance. This was truly a regrettable experience",2025-08-09T11:42:16.930025618Z,4 weeks ago

Basic amenities like slippers, toothbrush, and toothpaste were not provided upfront and had to be requested separately.

jai057,jai057_r2,Siddharth Chowdhary,3,"Pros:

Near Jaipur Junction railway station (within 2 km) and restaurants (e.g., Raj Mahal).

Budget-friendly.

Lift facility available.

Cons:

Poor service.

Intercom phone not working, so you have to call them using your personal phone for even small requests.

Poor cleanliness (even bed sheets are not washed).

Poor water quality (they don’t provide RO or Bisleri water bottles). Although, water quality issues exist across Jaipur.

No proper view from the hotel.

Some disturbances at night.

If you lose the key, be ready for a ₹1500 penalty. Even if you find it later, you still have to pay around ₹300.

Staff is neither welcoming nor friendly—unlike most Jaipur locals.

Poor Wi-Fi facility.

The biggest issue: No early check-in! One OYO representative assured us that early check-in would be available, as our train was reaching at 3 AM. However, it turned out to be a scam. We raised the issue with the hotel staff, but they failed to resolve it. Despite having plenty of space for waiting, they didn’t even inform us about it. Due to this, we had to book another nearby hotel for a short duration.

It’s just we had to face chaos and we struggled because of you. We know that we were helpless at that time bcoz the person who booked the rooms and talked with you was stuck in an emergency situation. But later we confirmed that you were lying about confirming extra charges with him. He confirmed that there was no extra charge. 3500 rupees for 2 rooms for 2 days
16th August and 17th August till 10 pm. But later you charged 3000 extra. So just want to say yes you mad money like this but cheating with customers is not good and not always profitable.

Suffice it to say, our experience of India significantly improved because they entered into our lives. Both Boby and Dipti are genuine people who care a great deal about creating a beautiful, memorable and easy experience for their guests. They go above and beyond what is expected and do it from their generous hearts. We felt like family in their home.
The rooms, though simple,  are decorated nicely, clean and spacious. The bathrooms are clean as well. The location is close to many popular sites and they are very good at helping you navigate Jaipur.

The entire property is breathtaking – full of character, history, and charm. Every part of the palace feels special, and just walking around it is a treat for the eyes.

Our suite was elegant, spacious, and incredibly comfortable. The decor reflected the royal heritage of the palace while still offering all the modern comforts you’d expect. The bed was super cozy, and every little detail – from the lighting to the bathroom essentials – was well thought out. It felt luxurious and homely at the same time.

What made the stay even more memorable were the unique experiences – vintage car rides, cultural performances, clay pot making, yoga, and even a horse carriage ride inside the palace grounds. These little touches added so much value to our trip and kept us engaged throughout.

Terrible experience at this hotel. Please stay away.

Not safe if you are with family(-women/kids).

The 5 star reviews are fake and paid. Not by real visitors. Not sure why google allow those to be posted.

Rooms at this hotel are small, dirty and busted(broken doors, paint chipping off from walls, plaster coming out from ceiling) with unpleasant smell.

During our visit, AC started leaking water in the middle of the night.

We noticed telephone lines were broken and had to use our phones to call main desk guy, so technically there is no room service.

They keep two water bottles in the room before check-in without telling you its chargeable. They will charge you at the time of checkout and sell a Rs.20 water bottle for Rs. 30.

Some 5-10 punks are always present at the property(- they were friends with the manager and always hanging around) and gambling/drinking at night. Not sure what other business property manager is running(-betting??).

There is no reason why goons have to be present at the hotel property. I am sure their primary business is something else and not hoteling.

Manager(Hari Om) was very very rude, please be prepared for the harassment if you stay at this hotel and ask them for basic needs. We saw him behaving badly with other guests.

Forget about additional services, they do not provide basic services for which they charge heavy tariff and you have to pay full amount at the time of check-in(-that's very unprofessional).

Our biggest mistake was that we trusted fake photos and fake reviews and booked it remotely without seeing hotel rooms in person(-we had no choice).

There were hidden charges—I was charged ₹30 for a water bottle with an MRP of ₹20.

From the moment we arrived, the service did not meet our expectations based on what was promised on your website. The check-in time was clearly stated as 2:00 PM, yet we were only given our room keys at 4:00 PM—a full two hours later. This delay was incredibly frustrating, especially after a long journey.
Even more disappointing is that despite lengthy conversations with the staff, we were not provided with the room we had originally booked. The accommodations we received were not in line with what was shown or described online and were not worth the price we paid.
Furthermore, the welcome and service upon arrival were far from warm or professional, which only added to our frustration.

The service is painfully slow. Their so-called breakfast is a nightmare — you’ll have to wait nearly 2 hours just for the simplest items, and when it finally arrives, it’s cold and poorly prepared. It’s better to step out and eat elsewhere rather than waste your morning waiting here.

I stayed at this property for a day, and it was an absolute nightmare.

**Rooms** – While the rooms are spacious, that’s the only positive. The toiletries are a joke—just an unmarked shampoo and a coagulated body wash that comes out in lumps, barely enough for one use. Nothing else provided. Water pressure is pathetic; it takes ages to get a decent flow. The toilets are not the cleanest with stains.

**Service** – Absolutely appalling. The reception is always unmanned; staff members are simply missing. The so-called ""manager"" is dishonest and overcharges for cabs. If you book through them, expect to pay extra. Even if the cab doesn’t cover all promised destinations, they still demand full payment. The manager’s attitude is downright aggressive—rude to the point of being threatening. On top of that, they charge extra for late check-out on an hourly basis. I was forced to pay ₹150 extra per room—₹300 total for two rooms despite the hotel being fully empty with no bookings.

On 2nd day of our stay we went to Amer Fort early in the morning. Our friend who was a local joined us at the fort. We all came back to room around 11am. We had planned to go out once again around 3-4 PM(which we did). Between this period our friend stayed back as he lived 25km from the hotel. The commute would have been a waste of time and money.
Now, during checkout the next day, the manager demanded an extra amount of 500-550 for that 11 am to 4pm window of stay - accusing us of letting our friend stay there for free. I have travelled to so many places and stayed at so many hotels but never have I ever come across such rule and If you do have such rules for your property do a better job of mentioning it on your website and other platforms where you list your accommodations. See the thing is when people travel, their friends and family in that city often drop by their hotels. Had we known about these hidden charges thn we would have not booked your hotel.",2025-08-01T20:52:24.908686778Z,a month ago

4. Staff brought beer in a broken glass that too after 30 min after ordering.

The room was spacious and comfortable in size; however, the interiors appeared outdated and would benefit from modernization. In comparison, other three- and four-star properties within the same price range tend to provide more contemporary rooms, enhanced amenities, and additional facilities.

The morning buffet was satisfactory, with a reasonable variety of options available. Service throughout the stay was adequate. That said, the in-room dining menu was average in both taste and presentation.

jai071,jai071_r2,Anuj Bhatnagar,4,"I booked this hotel because I had high expectations. My previous stay at Red Fox, Dehradun was great and I was expecting a similar experience. Well that didn’t happen. Let me summarize the good and bad.

Good:
* Location is good for business travelers and for those using their own cars.
* The quality of lunch and dinner preparations was excellent, mostly because it is made to order.
* Overall upkeep of the hotel is good.
* The waiting staff in the restaurant was perhaps the most polite I’ve found in Rajasthan.

Bad:
* Check-in was slow.
* The reception and lobby was located on the first floor, unlike most other hotels where it is up front at the entrance. This is always a surprise to a new guest, who generally expect it to be at the front door of the hotel.
* The bed was uncomfortable. Maybe this was only in my room but it is worth noting.
* The obsession with QR code for the restaurant menu. I know it’s a cost cutting measure but come on Red Fox! You can do better than most other budget hotels by simply adding a physical menu to your services.
* The breakfast was just about average.
* The closets in the rooms should at least have a sliding door to keep things safe. Not having it is another cost cutting measure but surely it can be addressed.

Finally, I must appreciate the differently abled staff members. I saw two of them and their energy was unmatched! A big thumbs up to them. 👍🏼",2025-08-17T13:07:25.381957098Z,2 weeks ago

jai073,jai073_r2,Rhea Chandra,1,"I don’t normally post bad reviews but I had to for this place. My partner and I are from New Zealand and we didn’t have a pleasant experience here and that is putting it nicely. We walked in at around 3pm and they were still cleaning the entire floor after having a wedding function there. There was literal rubbish and dirt in the hallway which was being swept out of each of the rooms. We had to dodge all that while walking to our room. Our room was really run down and still seemed dirty. The AC wasn’t working. My partner opened up one of the cupboards to be blasted with an overwhelming smell of urine. He closed it immediately and didn’t open it for the rest of the time we were staying there. Later on in the evening our entire room started smelling of urine/ sewer. None of the bathrooms had separation glass or curtain between the shower, toilet or sink so once we had a shower, the whole bathroom floor became wet. We had to have cold bucket showers on the first night as the shower head wasn’t working and hot water wasn’t coming out. We had other family members staying in other rooms so I asked them if their showers were working and they had the same situation as we did. We addressed this with the staff on the night and they said they will get someone to try to fix it in the morning. We don’t know if they fixed it because we moved to another room where we made sure the shower head was working as well as the hot water, AC and the room smelt some what okay. Someone else moved into our room and I noticed that as we walked past the room, the overwhelming smell of sewage was still present. Also, we caught a glimpse of the mattress protector that we were sleeping on while they were moving our rooms and it was absolutely disgusting - picture attached. The place itself is located close-ish to the city centre and it was easy to get an uber and the food is nice - those are the only positive things I can say about this place.

My partner and I would’ve moved out of the place as soon as we saw it however, we had 20 or so other family members staying there for a wedding so we tolerated it to the best of our abilities.

jai074,jai074_r5,Madhur Usgaonkar,3,"If you’re booking Radisson Blu expecting a true 5-star experience, you are likely to be very disappointed. It’s definitely not a 5 star. We stayed there from 15–17 August 2025 and almost every aspect fell short of what the Radisson name usually stands for.

The duty manager had promised a birthday cake and room decoration for our parents, ( had called
Him and spoken personally) but when we arrived, there was nothing. Even our rooms were kit ready even though we checked in way past the check in time.

The hotel itself feels tired. The entrance has an extremely small foyer with little charm, not impressive at all. The lobby has a seemed to have an artificial floral smell, and the overall look of the exterior and interior is dated and run down. Rooms are decently sized but lack any sense of luxury. Peeling paint, stains, and even loud plumbing noises that sounded like a drill machine made the stay uncomfortable.  They don’t feel too clean.

Service was equally underwhelming. Check-in at reception was delayed and inefficient. Breakfast was overcrowded and poorly managed, and the lobby-level restaurant was painfully slow with à la carte orders. Small but important details were overlooked, such as no iron in the room (though there was an ironing board), towels not replaced during service, and only very limited TV channels available.

On the positive side, room service was comparatively quick and the room size was comfortable. But overall, the hotel does not measure up to a 5-star standard.

My wife and I booked this hotel for our stay in Jaipur, India, expecting a safe and comfortable place to rest during our travels from the USA. Unfortunately, our experience turned out to be nothing short of a nightmare.

Around 11 PM on the night 1, while we were in our room sleeping, the ceiling suddenly collapsed on us. The room's fan was bent, and as debris fell, my wife was injured with some scratches and a small injury to her head. Thankfully, we weren’t more seriously hurt, but this incident left us shaken and traumatized. The hotel did offer us a refund and free meals, but after such a terrifying experience, we couldn’t trust the safety of the place anymore.

We chose this hotel based on its appearance and amenities, but after the ceiling collapse, it was clear that the building was poorly maintained. It didn’t seem safe, and the lack of guests staying there only added to our concerns. We immediately cut our trip short after the incident and decided to stay at another hotel.

I would strongly advise anyone considering this hotel to look elsewhere. It was a terrifying experience that left us with lasting trauma, and it’s not worth the risk to your safety.",2024-12-20T21:58:07.371105Z,8 months ago

jai077,jai077_r3,Dhwani,5,"My stay at Jaipur Inn was one of the most memorable experiences I've had during my solo travels. The space was inviting, and the family that runs it was incredibly warm, helpful, friendly, and generous. I was around for almost two weeks and stayed in the lovely Treetop Room which was spacious, clean, and tucked away in just the right corner of the property.

I was so glad to have chosen this place because it felt a lot less like a hotel and a lot more like staying with extended family. The food was simple, healthy and homely. The owner, Mr. Pushpendra, offered to take the guests on the most interesting, fun and offbeat morning walks which always ended with a belly full of some of Jaipur’s best breakfast foods.

During one of the morning walks, I even found myself at Govind Dev Ji's temple (which I probably wouldn't have visited otherwise, not being a particularly religious person), and ended up really enjoying the experience. On these walks, I also explored Smriti Van, Amber Fort, a couple of other temples, and wandered through the fascinating 'rastas' of old Jaipur in search of kachoris, dhoklas, barfis - and basically, all things great.

Jaipur Inn isn’t just a place to stay- it’s a way to experience Jaipur. You’ll see the city through the eyes of those who truly adore it.

Service at the all day dining is unbelievably slow! Food is average. In room dining orders took close to an hour. We had to cancel an order of kulcha as it took more than 40 mins to be sent and by then the food was cold!
I truly have never seen a 5 star hotel with such bad service.

The duty manager at the time of check in, Angad, is someone who effortlessly can make a good day go bad and from there, to worse, for the guests. Zero sensitivity as to how to handle guests in a tough situation. No presence of mind! I have never seen a hospitality professional who is so determined to be rigid!!

However, 2 people definitely need special mentioning.
1- Abhishek Sinha, the duty manager, was truly one of the few people who made a difference. He effortlessly sorted the situation that his colleague Angad had turned worse. So, thank you Abhishek!
2 - Inderaj at the coffee shop, a team member with hearing disability, was truly exceptional with his service!

One of the Worst Hotel Stay Experience.
First of all the Check In time was 2 PM amd till 3 PM the room was not ready. And the Staff was asking for 5 more Minutes everytime.
Secondly, During Check-in Briefing they told about the breakfast. and next day when we went to have it. They made us stand in the Dining area and denied giving breakfast saying it is not included. Counter Staff was rude and ill-mannered.
Atleast a Guest shouldn't be treared in such bad manner, where service is everything!!

jai081,jai081_r3,Sangeeta Biswas,2,"I am writing the honest review:-

Disappointing Hotel Stay
Our recent stay at the hotel was extremely disappointing. The actual experience fell short of the promised image and information. Here are some issues we faced:

1. *Unhygienic conditions*: The washroom lacked basic amenities like a bucket.
2. *Poor ventilation*: The exhaust system was inadequate.
3. *Cramped room*: The room space was insufficient.
4. *Lack of service*: Staff didn't clear dirty plates.

Overpriced
Considering the poor service and amenities, the rates were unjustifiably high. We wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, especially given the expensive tariffs.

Advice
Based on our experience, we'd advise potential guests to explore alternative options that offer better value for money.",2025-07-03T08:09:36.233271914Z,2 months ago

The staff at Hotel Clerks Amer is highly professional and cooperative. From front desk personnel to housekeeping, the team handles guest interactions with politeness and promptness. Their willingness to assist and resolve queries efficiently is commendable and adds positively to the hotel's service standards.

Responsiveness:
Requests are addressed in a timely manner, whether it involves room-related services, general inquiries, or housekeeping needs. The staff consistently maintains a helpful attitude, creating a smooth experience for guests.

Cleanliness and Hygiene – Toiletry Areas:
While general housekeeping is acceptable, more attention is needed in the toiletry areas, particularly the urinals in the public/common restrooms. These areas require more frequent cleaning and proper maintenance to avoid unpleasant odors and visible stains. Improved hygiene in these spots would significantly uplift the overall cleanliness of the hotel.

Maintenance in Restroom Facilities:
Some restroom fittings appear slightly worn and would benefit from routine inspection and upkeep. This includes proper disinfection, deodorizing, and ensuring all plumbing fixtures function optimally.

Conclusion:

Hotel Clerks Amer benefits from a well-trained and cooperative staff, but there is a clear need to enhance hygiene standards in toiletry areas, especially around urinals in public restrooms.

The decor had a touch of traditional Rajasthani elegance, which added to the overall vibe of the stay.

jai087,jai087_r2,crack cat,4,Stayed here for 2 days. Overall stay was decent. Rooms were clean and spacious though had some issue with the bathroom as after a period of time some sewage type smell comes from it. Food quality and most of dishes served during buffet was good though during rush service gets impacted. We were provided with complimentary cake which was not liked by us as it was more of cream and canned fruits. I think they seriously need to consider serving better or tastier ones which was served mostly during buffet. Staff attitude was polite and welcoming,2025-08-17T14:47:22.574430690Z,2 weeks ago
jai087,jai087_r3,Rajni Rawat,5,"I have stayed at multiple locations of Novotel and it’s a delightful experience every time!
Stayed at the Jaipur location this time which is very conveniently located towards the outskirts of the city and easily accessible from the Mumbai expressway.
The rooms were very spacious and the bathrooms were pretty big as well. One of the areas we absolutely loved was the pool area, which is very relaxing and complete with a seating space and a separate area for lounge chairs.
The service was absolutely impeccable! We were very well taken care of, and the staff was always around to ask us if we needed anything or make changes to accommodate all the guests. One thing that can be improved though is their buffet menu, which I felt was lacking variety. The breakfast buffet was nice, with ample choices of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The lunch buffet, however, could be improved.
Overall, we had a nice stay and would definitely recommend it to friends and family!",2025-08-10T15:30:58.469253857Z,3 weeks ago

The food all is Indian food, they don’t have continental food. Every day breakfast the same food. Which is we are not satisfied because it’s a five star hotel. We are very disappointed, the staff in the front desk they are very bad attitude. The window in our room full of shit of bird.

A property endorsed by Marriott sets a high bar for expectations, but our stay was utterly disappointing. The experience was marred by significant issues from start to finish.
Pros:
The breakfast and dinner buffet spreads were excellent.
The staff in the dining area were courteous and attentive.
Cons:
Poor Check-in: Greeted by unsupervised trainees who were inept at handling guests.
Health Hazard: The swimming pool was infested with pigeons, a major hygiene concern.
Neglected Facilities: The gym was unsupervised at 7:45 AM, and the club lounge coffee machine was unserviced at 10:30 PM.
Worn-Out Property: Our club room felt tired, and the entire building had a dilapidated feel, far from the quality expected of the Marriott brand.

jai091,jai091_r4,dilip singh,2,"This property is far from a true five-star experience – at best, it's a premium three-star hotel.
There was absolutely nothing that reflected the Sheraton brand's reputation for world-class hospitality.

When someone books a five-star hotel, they do so for the premium experience – impeccable service, comfort, and attention to detail. Unfortunately, none of that was present here. The property felt more like a three-star hotel, and the service barely matched even two-star standards.

The room experience was particularly disappointing.
When we entered, we were greeted with excessive humidity, visible mold on the wooden furniture, and a general sense of dampness – clear signs of poor hygiene and maintenance. The room was much smaller than advertised – definitely not 300 sq ft – and the washroom was extremely cramped, around 25 sq ft at best.

We had to request a room change to the 7th floor, which was marginally better in terms of cleanliness. However, even this room had broken fixtures – the phone cord and tissue holder were damaged, the sink was unclean (attached photo), and we even spotted cockroaches in the washroom.

The grooming kit provided was of such poor quality that using the toothbrush caused gum bleeding. The glass shower enclosure was also unhygienic and poorly maintained.

Room service was equally frustrating.
Requesting even basic items like a water bottle took a minimum of 30 minutes – as if they were sourcing it from another planet. This level of service is completely unacceptable, especially at this price point.

The location is another drawback – the hotel is situated in a congested area, near coaching centres and lacks the ambiance one expects from a premium property.

At ₹7000 per night, this stay was simply not worth the money.
During our 3-day, 2-night visit, we did not experience anything remotely close to five-star standards. Thankfully, we hadn’t booked an extra night – we were just waiting to head back to Delhi.

jai096,jai096_r1,Cas Agnew,5,"We absolutely loved the Samode Haveli. The courtyard bar is a gorgeous place to hang out in and have a drink. The interval room is quite quite beautiful where they greet you with a drink. The area by the pool is relaxing also with three cabanas and the service friendly and lovely. The pool is a delightful space. Sunbeds facing the garden are best. The gym is modern and has a nice aspect in an air conditioned glazed balcony overlooking the pool. Our room, 118 was super large and comfortable. Housekeeping and laundry were impeccable quick and polite. Food at the restaurant was delicious - from the breakfast dhosas, bhurji to the evening tikka / tandoori chicken with delicious breads and jeers or veg rice and amazing vegetable dishes.
Service was impeccable through out. The courtyard was cool enough in August for us to eat outside in the evening but the restaurant room is glorious as is the winter bar next to it which is stunning. Casting around for an issue the only one I could find was that I went to get our bags on arrival as I wanted a swim and they took a while to arrive. In other words Samode Haveli is near perfect. We had a lovely stay in the Oberoi in Agra and were wondering if we should’ve gone to them in Jaipur - Samode was by far the better choice with atmospheric and beautiful settings and top service. Loved it.",2025-08-15T04:38:41.849229463Z,3 weeks ago

I’ve been living in India since 2010 and always wanted to visit this hotel. After a not-so-great experience at Neemrana Fort, my family wasn’t interested in antique-style hotels — until today, when we came on a whim. We’re so glad we did!

We stayed in a Deluxe Suite and loved it — spacious, clean, and full of charm. If you enjoy swimming, the pool is a definite highlight.

Overall, a great stay for the whole family. We’d happily come back!",2025-07-31T15:44:04.503975461Z,a month ago

jai101,jai101_r4,MUSIC Loverr,5,"Sure! Here's a 200-word hotel room review you can use or customize further:

---

I recently stayed at this hotel and had a pleasant experience overall. The room was clean, well-maintained, and tastefully decorated, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The bed was large and very comfortable, with high-quality linens that made for a restful night's sleep. The bathroom was spotless and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. I appreciated the thoughtful touches like a coffee maker, mini-fridge, and complimentary bottled water.

The staff were friendly and professional, always ready to assist with any requests. Housekeeping did a great job each day, and the front desk was efficient during both check-in and check-out.

One minor downside was the limited soundproofing; I could occasionally hear noise from the hallway. Also, while the room had most modern amenities, a few extra USB charging ports would have been helpful.

Location-wise, the hotel is in a convenient area close to restaurants, shops, and public transportation. It made exploring the city very easy.

Overall, I’d highly recommend this hotel room to both business and leisure travelers. It offers great value for the price, and I would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit.

Many are concerned about safety, specially girl solo travelers but after living here, I can assure you that it is very safe. There is a guard present at the entrance of the facility and area is also a very safe and lively place.

jai102,jai102_r3,Harshita Bakshi,3,"Hotel Arco Palace, Jaipur

Overview:
Hotel Arco Palace is a standard hotel, easily accessible and located near Sindhi Camp. Here’s a list of pros and cons based on my personal experience.

Pros:
1. Location:
Perfect location — barely 500 meters from Sindhi Camp Metro Station.

1.Hawa Mahal – around 15 minutes

2.Jal Mahal – around 25 minutes

3.Amer Fort – around 40 minutes

2. Reasonable Rates:
The rooms are fairly priced.

3. Hotel Staff:
The staff is extremely prompt in their service and also really sweet and kind.

4. Check-in & Check-out:
We arrived early at around 8:30 AM. After waiting for about 1.5 hours, we were allotted our room. Usually, hotels don’t allow early check-in, but they did, which was really great and helpful.

5. Room:
The room had proper ventilation, and the mattresses were of really good quality. Usually, hotel mattresses are way too hard, making sleep uncomfortable, but here we were able to sleep peacefully because of the good-quality mattress.

Cons:
1. Surroundings:
The hotel is near the bus stop, so there’s a lot of commotion. The area is congested.

2. Limited Space:
The hotel is built as a standalone building.

3. Rooms:
The rooms are big in size with proper ventilation, but the walls were withering. The room was cleaned only on the surface level — in-depth cleaning was not done. I even saw a cockroach.
There was no kettle in the room, so one couldn’t prepare anything for themselves.

4. Washroom:
This was the biggest disappointment for me.

The flush didn’t have proper capacity.

The washroom was constructed in a way that water couldn’t drain properly.

There was no separation between the seat and bathing area, which was awful.

The AC conduit pipe was attached in the washroom, so the washroom was constantly wet — making it very unpleasant.

The sink was also unclean.

Final Rating:
I genuinely hope they work on these shortcomings.

All the very best to the hotel — and kudos to the staff for being extremely cooperative and trying to make the stay better.",2025-08-21T14:17:20.817741195Z,2 weeks ago

Shoutout to Manish and Shriya as well for making our stay extra special! There were a few other staffs that were so lovely but I can’t recall the name!

From the moment we arrived, we felt truly welcomed. A delicious cake and a bottle of wine were waiting in our room, which made our experience even more special.

The absolute highlight of our visit was the cooking class with the Barli family and Chef Govind. It was a unique evening filled with warmth, cultural exchange, and wonderful insights into authentic local recipes.

Dileep Kothi is a true oasis of peace in the heart of bustling Jaipur. We can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a refined, personal, and unforgettable experience.",2025-08-20T22:58:42.928836635Z,2 weeks ago

Conclusion and feedback:

Staff treatment 10/10

Food and dining: 10/10

- amazing food and quick service

Details and Design: 10/10

- well kept area, clean and luxurious. Really brings out the beautiful details of Rajasthan.

Although they did get hassled with the number of guests during breakfast (honestly I’ve seen much more crowd than that in other hotels, which staff could manage seamlessly). Maybe the blame should go to the furniture, the chairs were quite broad, which occupied a lot of space unnecessarily.

The hotel had beautifully embraced the spirit of Independence Day, and the theme extended all the way to the buffet spread, a thoughtful and creative touch that instantly caught my attention.
We opted for the buffet dinner, and the variety on offer was impressive. There was a perfect balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, each prepared with care and packed with flavour. I especially appreciated how some of the dishes were inspired by the tricolour theme, not only did they look festive, but they also tasted wonderful. It was clear that the chefs had put a lot of heart into curating a menu that celebrated the occasion while delivering on quality and taste.
The ambiance of the restaurant added to the experience. The decor was elegant yet welcoming, and the Independence Day theme was tastefully incorporated without being over-the-top. What truly stood out, though, was the service. The staff was courteous, attentive, and genuinely warm, always checking in with a smile to make sure we had everything we needed. It’s the kind of hospitality that makes you want to come back.

We booked a suite at Vijayran Palace to celebrate our wedding anniversary — and without a doubt, it turned out to be the best experience of my life so far.

From the moment we entered, everything — the food, staff behavior, prompt service, luxury facilities, hygiene, cleanliness, and the peaceful environment — was simply flawless. I would wholeheartedly give 10 out of 10 to each and every aspect.

But what made our experience truly unforgettable was our anniversary celebration. We had the pleasure of coordinating with Mr. Sumit for the arrangements, and to our surprise, he and his team didn’t just meet our expectations — they exceeded them in every possible way.
What we imagined turned into something even more magical, all thanks to their efforts. 💖

jai113,jai113_r5,D B,1,"This may be a great property going by the reviews, but the management mentality is quite pathetic i must say. If i could, i would give them negative stars.

I made a reservation for a 3 day stay at their property and within a couple of hours of doing so came down with a serious flu and high grade fever.

I requested them to make an exception to their 'no refund' policy on human and compassionate grounds by offering me a refund or at least a date change. But they just cold heartedly refused to budge and did not cooperate in anyway whatsoever.

Its my past experience that even though prestigious properties frequently publish their fares as non refundable online, they generally treat that as a guideline only and happily override it in genuine, human circumstances. They recognise the importance of treating people with respect, care and humanity while still protecting their interests.

But not Vijayran Palace. No trace of compassion, empathy or consideration for others on human grounds. Just pure, unadulterated greed and mindless parroting of 'policy'.

In the world that they inhabit - policies, which are meant to be guidelines, have become excuses to not use one's own brain and agency.

Disappointed. Id like to urge travellers to consider this - we all vote with our wallets. There are plenty of good properties but not many good people left in the world.

If we use our wallet to support properties that put care for people above blind and thoughtless pursuit of policy and pure greed, it would be one more way of making this world a better place.

Consider this, before booking your stay here. How we spend our money can make a difference in the world. Make it count.",2025-07-29T07:30:32.782704378Z,a month ago

All the facilities like housekeeping, room service, and overall hospitality were really good. The staff was polite, helpful, and professional throughout the stay, which made the experience even better.

The only drawback was the Jacuzzi — it took almost 2 hours to fill and another 2 hours to empty, which made it difficult to use as expected. It definitely needs improvement in terms of functionality and convenience.

Highlights

- Rooftop Pool - A great spot to relax and enjoy the view

- Courteous Staff - The check-in and check-out process was smooth, and the staff were friendly and helpful

- Complimentary Hi Tea - The hotel's gesture of providing a complimentary evening tea was appreciated.

I don’t usually take the time to write long reviews unless something really stands out—and let me tell you, my stay at Holiday Inn Express & Suites Jaipur Gopalpura was nothing short of exceptional from start to finish. 🌟

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with warm smiles and welcoming energy. The staff were incredibly kind, helpful, and genuinely eager to make my stay comfortable. Whether it was the front desk, housekeeping, or the restaurant staff, everyone I interacted with made me feel like a valued guest, not just a room number.

The hotel room itself was lovely—modern, clean, and thoughtfully designed. The bed was cozy, everything was spotless, and the amenities were just right for a relaxing and enjoyable stay. The space felt fresh, stylish, and well taken care of.

But what really took my breath away was the pool area. 😍 Wow! It’s like an oasis in the city. Peaceful, clean, and beautifully maintained. Whether it was early morning or sunset, spending time by the pool made me feel like I was on a mini vacation within my vacation. It’s definitely one of the highlights of the property.

This hotel struck the perfect balance between comfort, efficiency, and warmth. I have absolutely nothing negative to say—and that’s rare! My experience here reminded me of why I love the IHG brand, and this particular property raised the bar even higher.

If you’re thinking about staying here, don’t hesitate. Whether you’re in Jaipur for business or pleasure, the Holiday Inn Express & Suites Jaipur Gopalpura will treat you right.

It's a super bad room with no windows to open and  Unbearable smell. I only say this so you don't go to this place, it's the worst.

jai116,jai116_r3,Amit panwar,1,"Absolute nonsense hotel wanna gice negative star but google aint allowing me.

I had one of the worst dining experiences of my life at Palace Hotel Jaipur. What was supposed to be a pleasant meal turned into an absolute nightmare.

Firstly, they served me rotten food. I ordered Paneer Butter Masala, and the paneer was clearly spoiled—sour, rubbery, and totally inedible and was prepared atleast 12 hours before served to us. It was obvious they either don’t care about food hygiene or are cutting corners in the worst way possible. Serving rotten paneer veggie in Jaipur’s heat is not just disgusting—it’s dangerous.

As if that wasn’t bad enough, they refused to turn on the air conditioning despite the sweltering heat. They made me sit in a separate restaurant area, not the main one, which was basically a an oven where the AC barely worked (if at all). I have no idea why I was treated differently, but the main dining area was clearly better maintained—and I was kept out of it for no reason.

Absolutely no sense of hospitality, cleanliness, or customer service.

jai120,jai120_r1,Ranjan Kumar,1,"My recent stay at Sarovar Portico was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

Check-in Delays & Zero Assistance
I arrived around 2:00–2:30 PM, the standard check-in time, yet I was asked to wait “5 minutes” to check room availability — which turned into 20–25 minutes. I had 2–3 pieces of luggage and requested help from reception, but even after waiting 10–15 minutes, no one came. I ended up carrying everything myself.

Basic Amenities Missing
There were no mineral water bottles in the room. I had to call three times, and each time it felt like they were stalling. After much follow-up, I finally got two small bottles. I also ordered food online, but they initially refused to allow delivery and later outright refused to send someone to collect it.

Terrible Hygiene Standards
The room’s mattresses were full of fungus — an extremely serious health hazard. I have photos to prove it. In the morning, someone had vomited inside the lift, and no staff bothered to clean it. This is the kind of “hospitality” they offer.

Breakfast Disaster
Breakfast service deserves zero stars. Bowls were mostly unavailable, and staff were nowhere to be found to assist.

Pathetic Room Service
Calling “Room Service” always connects to reception, where you’re told to dial another number for help — which no one ever answers. I have been waiting 45 minutes for an iron to press my clothes as I write this review.

Bottom Line
From delayed check-in to unhygienic rooms, poor service, and unresponsive staff, Sarovar Portico failed in every basic aspect of hospitality. This is not what one expects from a reputed hotel brand.

Would I recommend this place? Absolutely NOT

There are a lot more things to write but o thought of highlighting these basic issues.

Our trip to Jaipur turned out to be one of the most memorable family vacations we've ever had. Coming from Shimla during the peak of summer, we were pleasantly surprised by how refreshing and vibrant the experience was.

Each morning was a cultural treat — we explored majestic forts and historic landmarks, soaking in the rich heritage of the Pink City. But what truly made the trip extraordinary was our stay at the hotel.

After returning from our adventures, a dip in the rooftop swimming pool was the perfect way to unwind. The water was cool, clean, and incredibly soothing. As evening descended, the hotel came alive with beautiful live music and singing. The singer was truly outstanding, and the quality of the music was excellent — soulful, heartfelt, and deeply moving. It created a magical atmosphere, one of those rare moments you know you'll remember forever.

The entire vibe of the hotel was positive and peaceful. The temperature was surprisingly comfortable, the environment relaxing, and the staff warm and welcoming. Every meal we had was a delight — delicious, well-prepared, and satisfying.

My wife, who is deeply passionate about music, was especially touched by the performances. We both felt completely recharged — as if we had stepped out of time and into a calm, joyful escape. It didn’t feel like summer anymore; it felt like serenity.

Thank you for such an amazing experience. These are the memories we’ll carry with us for a long, long time!

Stay - Our room was upgraded on arrival without us asking for it. That was a pleasant surprise. Ambience of the rooms is very traditional and reminds of old world charm. The rooms were nothing short of royalty. Kids were very excited to see peacocks on the property. Open lawns and lush green surroundings in monsoons were absolute breather for us.

Staff- Staff is very courteous and soft spoken. They were very attentive and were always smiling.

Food- Since, i was traveling from Hyderabad, i found the food absolutely delicious. The spices were moderate and I would rate it 10/10. The property also organised puppet show, music and cultural dance at night.

Location- Location of the property is quite good and near to all prominent places in Jaipur.

The front desk manager was extremely unprofessional. His tone and attitude were completely inappropriate, making the entire interaction unpleasant. He came across as arrogant, as if he was doing us a favor by speaking to us. It was one of the worst experiences we've had with a front desk representative.

Rooms:
The rooms are quite nice but on the expensive side without membership given the amenities and distance from tourist places.

Food:
The food was delicious, no doubt about that. However, it's important to note that without a room booking, guests are not allowed to dine in the cafeteria due to high demand and long waiting times—which is completely understandable. That said, the way this was communicated could have been much more courteous. After traveling over two hours to reach the property and bringing a few guests along to experience the place for a potential upcoming event, the tone and attitude we encountered were quite disappointing and left us genuinely shocked",2025-06-29T17:35:03.878913498Z,2 months ago

The buffet restaurant was supposed to open at 12, but they kept delaying it's opening until 1:15. Anyway..all is forgiven if the food is good right?

Well..there were zero starters.. and the spread was...the worst I have seen of any five star. There were only two non veg items. One a mutton curry, and two some Chinese chicken dish. The dessert counter seemed like it had been yesterdays or the day before... No juices..nada..That's it.

It's the kind of buffet you eat that you later wonder what you ate!

jai125,jai125_r1,Prachi Rawat,5,"A Heartfelt Thank You to Brij Nest – A Stay I Will Never Forget.

This is not just a review – it is a thank you from the bottom of my heart to Brij Nest and their incredible staff.

I was traveling alone with my 1.5-year-old baby, and to be honest, he is not an easy child. I was nervous and unsure how the trip would go. But from the moment I spoke to Brij Nest, all my worries started to fade.

I called to request an early check-in because my train was reaching at 11:15 AM. Without any hesitation, they said, “Ma’am, you can come before 12, we’ll keep the room ready for you.” This simple reply filled me with peace and comfort. While other places said no, Brij Nest welcomed me with open arms.

When I reached and entered the suite, I was honestly speechless. The room was spotless, beautifully designed, and so spacious. I have very high cleanliness standards and even carry my own bedsheets, towels, and slippers. But here, everything was so clean and perfect – it felt like they understood exactly what I needed.

There was a smart TV for my baby’s favorite shows, big windows with lovely views, and lots of space for him to play. But more than anything, it was the staff’s kindness that touched me the most.

Every single person there treated us like family. They noticed small things without us even asking. When we ordered tea, they brought a chocolate for my baby. During breakfast, they saw I was struggling to manage him, and one of them brought a soft toy to keep him busy – and then gave it to him as a gift. I was truly moved.

The bathtub in the room was a blessing. My son enjoyed it so much, and seeing him happy made me happy too.

What really made this place special was the way the staff cared for us – not because they had to, but because they truly wanted to. Every little detail showed their thoughtfulness. We never had to wait. We never had to ask twice. Their warmth, patience, and care made all the difference.

I was scared to travel alone with a toddler, but Brij Nest turned my trip into a beautiful memory. It felt nothing like a hotel – it felt like a home full of kind hearts.

To the amazing team at Brij Nest – thank you for everything. You didn’t just give us a stay, you gave us comfort, peace, and unforgettable kindness. I will always be grateful.

With all my heart,
Thank you. 💖",2025-05-31T04:27:41.516273Z,3 months ago

What truly set this experience apart was their unwavering attention to detail and genuine care for our family's needs. Travelling with a little one can be challenging, but they made it seamless. Upon arrival, we found our room thoughtfully prepared with a comfortable crib, soft blankets, and even a selection of baby-friendly toiletries – a touch we deeply appreciated.

The staff were incredibly warm and accommodating. They went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, always with a smile and a helpful suggestion. The kitchen staff were particularly understanding, happily preparing pureed meals and warming bottles at any hour.

The property itself is a gem. The ambiance was serene and inviting, creating a true sense of relaxation.

We were also impressed with the Library - the south Indian restaurant.

Brij Nest is more than just a boutique property; it's a home away from home, especially for families with infants. Their dedication to personalized service and their understanding of the unique challenges of travelling with a baby made our stay truly unforgettable. We left feeling refreshed and grateful for their exceptional hospitality. We wholeheartedly recommend Brij Nest to anyone seeking a truly special and family-friendly retreat.

jai125,jai125_r5,Shilpa Jaiswal,4,"Brij Nest is a compact property located within the same premises as Clarks. It has a limited number of rooms and offers basic facilities. The property is clean, well-kept, and the staff is courteous. However, it’s small in scale—with only a vegetarian restaurant that also doubles up as the reception area. There is no separate coffee shop, lobby space, or dedicated meeting area within Brij Nest itself.

For additional facilities like a proper lobby, coffee house, buffet breakfast, gym, swimming pool, or meeting areas, guests can access the main Clarks  building, which is a short walk away within the same campus.

Brij Nest is not directly reachable by car—vehicles are parked at Clarks, and a battery cart is used to transfer guests and luggage to and from the rooms.

Rooms on higher floors offer slightly better views and more light.

Overall, Brij Nest is a quiet and functional place for a short stay, especially suitable for those who don’t mind walking over to Clarks for extended facilities.",2025-06-28T07:04:07.396410844Z,2 months ago

jai128,jai128_r1,Marie D,2,"I stayed at this hotel with my partner and unfortunately we did not enjoy our stay.

The bedroom was sufficient, however the bathroom was not up to standard - with a scratched bathtub that needed replacement, and a faulty sensor light that would turn off while I was showering.

The cleaners clearly did not vacuum under the bed as when I shone a torch under to find an earring it was extremely dirty - not good for my partners asthma.

We were hoping to enjoy the pool however it was  completely unappealing. Positioned directly next to the road, there was constant road noise and lack of privacy. The pool didn’t look clean and was surrounded by pigeons (and their poo). We noticed three dead pigeons, one by the pool and two on the balconies overlooking trapped in nets draped by the hotel. We informed reception of this and asked for them to be removed on the first day of our stay. On our final day the dead pigeons were still there.

We also unfortunately lost our room key card, and during this stress, when we informed the receptionist she rolled her eyes at us. This is not expected as a paying guest.

Positives were the room service - food and drink was affordable and satisfactory. Additionally, the building was well located for sight seeing and had pleasant interior design.

Families pay annual maintenance fees for Mahindra resorts - the money is clearly not going into maintenance as this was not up to standard. We recommend not visiting this resort if you are a member.",2025-08-29T12:05:55.547277124Z,a week ago

jai128,jai128_r4,Santosh,2,"Negative Review for CM Holiday Resort, Jaipur:

My experience at CM Holiday Resort, Jaipur was quite disappointing. The room service was extremely poor — even after calling 2-3 times, no one responded. There wasn't even a dustbin kept inside the room, which is a basic requirement.

The swimming pool was very small and unhygienic, definitely not up to resort standards. The food quality was also below average and not worth the price.

They charge nearly ₹1000 for a facility called the ""Happy Hub,"" but there’s hardly anything available. There were no cultural activities at all during our stay, which was quite surprising for a place that calls itself a resort. In reality, this felt more like a regular hotel, not a proper resort.

Positive Note:

However, I would like to appreciate Lucky from the restaurant staff for his caring and attentive service. He was polite, helpful, and made sure we were comfortable during our meals.",2025-06-23T16:02:57.647507376Z,2 months ago

We reached the property a little late (around 7 PM) and the property looked uninhabited. While signing the register, I noticed just 2 other rooms were occupied that day and only two staff were seen around. The receptionist cordially welcomed us and to be frank he was very polite. But I felt the lack of professionalism and also some kind of safety concerns inside that building.
About the room; it was spacious and  clean provided with a bottle of water and a kettle. Our deluxe a/c room was both spacious and elegant; toilet facilities including geyser were fine. The same reception boy came to took orders later and tbh the dinner was superb and reasonable. We had to checkout early in the morning, as almost all the tourist spots were far from there.

From the moment we arrived, the experience was beyond our expectations. As students, we didn’t expect such top-notch service, but the staff here treated us with the utmost kindness, care, and respect.

The rooms were clean, well-maintained, and beautifully arranged. Everything—from the comfortable beds to the hygienic bathrooms—was spot-on. What really made the difference, though, was the warmth and hospitality of the staff. They were always ready to help, always smiling, and genuinely made us feel like home. Despite being young guests, they never made us feel less important and gave us the same excellent service as they would to any guest.

The food was delicious, the environment was peaceful, and the overall vibe of Mahadev Villa was just perfect for a pleasant and safe stay. It's not just a hotel, it’s a home away from home. I strongly recommend it to anyone visiting Jaipur—families, solo travelers, and especially students like us.
Thank you, Mahadev Villa team, for going above and beyond. You made our trip even more special, and we’ll always remember your kindness and hospitality.😊",2025-08-04T12:30:12.406346264Z,a month ago

The swimming pool was disgustingly dirty — a breeding ground for infections. I nearly ended up with a serious eye infection because of their complete negligence in maintaining hygiene. It’s unacceptable and downright dangerous.

What’s even more shameful is their blatantly discriminatory behavior. If you arrive in a fancy car, they’ll treat you like royalty. But come on a scooty? Be prepared to get lectured with a new rule for every little thing you do, They literally made us order swimming costume which was not informed at the time of Check in. They judge guests based on appearances, not on basic respect or hospitality.

The housekeeping staff were polite, but sadly, they’re the only decent part of this place. The owner’s arrogant, classist attitude is driving this place straight into the ground.

I had an amazing stay at Zostel Jaipur! The cleanliness of the place was top-notch, and the overall vibe was just perfect—relaxed, social, and full of positive energy. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, especially David, who went out of his way to make everyone feel welcome and included.

There were plenty of fun activities that made it easy to meet fellow travelers and create great memories. Whether you’re a solo traveler or with friends, Zostel Jaipur is a fantastic place to stay. Can’t wait to come back!

jai143,jai143_r5,Arbaz Gad,5,"I was beyond excited to experience Zostel during my travels, and the Zostel Jaipur property was my very first introduction. I’ve stayed here twice so far, and let me tell you—the experience has been nothing short of amazing. Although I came solo, I didn’t return home solo—I made friends here that I’ll cherish for life. The common area is the heart of the property. They have a cozy kitchen and a cafeteria that serves one of the best breakfasts at budget-friendly prices. I especially loved their variety of sandwiches and homelike dinner!

Zostel makes sure you never feel like just a guest. From the receptionist to the chef, everyone treats you like one of their own. I’ve experienced both the dorms and the private deluxe room, but if you’re traveling solo like me, I highly recommend staying in the dorms—you’ll thank me later!

Oh, and no worries about the location—it’s just a short walk from Hawa Mahal, right in the middle of the Pink City.

Thank you, Zostel, for all the memories I’ll cherish for a lifetime!",2025-04-23T07:05:10.759338Z,4 months ago

We were given a temporary room for early check-in, but when we asked for our original room the next morning, it still hadn't been cleaned. This delayed our plans to explore Jaipur, as we couldn't get ready in time. To make matters worse, someone banged on our door in the middle of the night and ran away, which felt unsafe. Also, there’s a big dumpster right near the place, adding to the unpleasantness. This might be okay for a large group looking for a budget stay, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a group of girls.

Luckily for me, I had booked this room just to freshen up as I had a flight to catch the same day. Therefore didn't have to stay overnight there. I wouldn't have slept on those beds and would have shifted to a better hostel nearby if I had to. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a neat and comfortable place to stay.

- Locker with key is provided.
- Towels aren't provided.
- The hostel has two open terraces, to chit-chat, drink and relax.
- Sachin, the front desk manager was nice and welcoming. But he didn't change my sheets the second time i had booked here, on the 15-16 july 2024. He kept delaying with the reason that other sheets are yet to dry, and then eventually i fell asleep waiting for him. And checked-out in the morning.
- Curtains for beds were missing.
- AC was off during the daytime. In the night time also, it doesn't cool much.
- Bathroom was clean. Overall hostel premises were also tidy.
- I had booked it at around 215rs./night on goibibo.
- The location on Goibibo is wrong. The right location is on Gmaps. It's in a private lane called 'Green colony'(see photo).

Soon after checking in, I noticed bed bugs on the pillows and beds. I reported the issue to the hotel staff, and while they did try to help by changing my room—not once, but twice—it was already late at night, and the entire situation was extremely inconvenient and stressful. Despite the room changes, the problem persisted, and I couldn’t sleep at all due to fear and discomfort.

Eventually, I had no choice but to cancel the rest of my stay and find accommodation elsewhere at the last minute. This experience was both disappointing and distressing, especially since I had chosen the hotel expecting a comfortable stay.

We immediately raised the issue with the F&B staff. He agreed that the momos smelled off and said he would escalate it to the manager. Initially, we were told the dish would be replaced. However, after some time, we received a call saying that we had placed the order an hour ago, so they couldn’t accept the complaint — even though we hadn’t even eaten a single momo from the platter.

What’s worse is that after this incident, they removed my ID from MakeMyTrip, making it impossible for me to leave feedback. This kind of behavior is not just unprofessional, it’s unacceptable. It feels like they are trying to silence genuine customer complaints.

This was my second stay at this hotel, but sadly, it seems they do not value loyal guests. I do not recommend this place to anyone — especially if you care about food safety and decent service.

jai150,jai150_r3,Pradeep Malik,1,"Having stayed at this hotel previously with a very positive experience, I was looking forward to my return. I remembered it as a well-maintained establishment with good service. Unfortunately, my recent stay was a complete and utter disappointment, revealing a shocking decline in property maintenance, staff competence, and overall management.

The Room: Cramped and Neglected
The first letdown was the room itself. Upon entering, it was immediately clear that the standards have plummeted. The room was very smelly and was with very bad odour. The room was incredibly small and felt cramped, a stark contrast to my previous stay. To make matters worse, basic amenities were not in working order. The television was completely non-functional, which is a fundamental failure in a hotel room's offerings. It was the first sign that maintenance and attention to detail are no longer a priority here.

Service Failure: Ignored Requests
My booking specifically requested a large, single bed. Instead, I was given a room with two separate, smaller beds, which is uncomfortable and not what was promised. I immediately contacted the front desk to have this rectified, hoping for a simple resolution. Despite my clear requests, absolutely nothing was done. The issue was completely ignored for the duration of my stay. This demonstrated a complete lack of concern for guest comfort and a failure to honour booking specifics.

The Breakfast Fiasco: A Blatant Disregard for a Paid Booking
The most frustrating and unacceptable issue occurred with our breakfast arrangement. My booking confirmation clearly and explicitly stated that the stay included breakfast for two people. However, when only a single person  went to the dining area, the hotel staff flatly denied this. They insisted that our booking did not include breakfast and refused to honour the terms of our reservation.

Even after I presented my booking confirmation as proof, the staff remained unhelpful, dismissive, and unwilling to resolve the situation. This was not a simple misunderstanding; it was a blatant refusal to provide a service that was already paid for. It felt incredibly dishonest and left us feeling cheated.

A Total Failure of Management
This entire experience points to a systemic failure in management and staff training. From ignored maintenance issues (the TV, smelly room), to disregarded guest requests (the bed), to the outright denial of paid services (the breakfast), there was a consistent pattern of incompetence and poor customer service. The staff seemed indifferent and unwilling to solve problems.

It is disheartening to see a once-good hotel fall into such a state of disrepair and disservice. My pleasant memories have been completely overshadowed by this terrible experience. I can no longer recommend this hotel to anyone. Potential guests should be extremely wary; what you book is not what you will get, and the management seems to have lost control entirely.

2. Rooms are not well maintained, need renovations
3. The overcharge for room service/water bottles if you're not careful

Overall, for a few days of visit, there are better options available in the area",2024-09-02T03:35:18.418626Z,a year ago

jai151,jai151_r5,Naveen Dugar,2,"I stayed here in Oct 2024 for a family of 4 with 3 adults and
1 kid based on pics available online (very deceiving to say the least, so do not fall for it) from a room booking app Agoda. We booked it trusting Agoda reputation but we're highly disappointed. It was a Deluxe Triple Room and we're provided an extra bed for my kid.

Firstly the room size is so small that there is not enough space even to move and then they put an extra bed for child in the only walkway which make any possible movement impossible.

The room cleanliness is just ok and is definitely NOT recommended for FAMILY. Only for short (i would rather say a couple of hours at the most) business trips or couples needing cheap accommodation. There were bed bugs and smelly sheets.

Overall a very disappointing experience and the only positive is it's proximity to railway station, which is just opposite to the hotel.",2024-10-13T02:41:12.039350Z,10 months ago

jai154,jai154_r1,Vinod Gupta,1,"Extremely Unprofessional Behaviour & Poor Facilities.

I had one of the worst experiences at this hotel. When I politely asked the owner about car parking arrangements, instead of providing a clear answer, he became aggressive and started shouting abusively. This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable for anyone running a hospitality business.

On top of that, the hotel does not have any parking facility at all, but they mislead customers into thinking they do. When guests try to leave honest feedback, they manipulate reviews, post fake positive ones, and even abuse customers who give a genuine 1-star rating.

In terms of facilities, the place is far below basic standards:

Cleanliness & Hygiene: The rooms and bathrooms are not properly maintained. Dirty linens, foul smell, and dust everywhere.

No Room Service: Despite claiming to offer room service, there was none available during my stay. Requests for even drinking water were ignored.

Unprofessional Attitude: Instead of resolving issues, the management tries to silence complaints by intimidation.

A hotel is supposed to make guests feel comfortable and respected. Here, I felt unsafe, unwelcome, and completely dissatisfied.

⚠️ Warning to future travelers: Please don’t get misled by manipulated ratings. Read the genuine 1-star reviews carefully before booking. There are far better options available nearby where your money will actually be respected.

If you rate them as per their service, Owner will come up the excuse that you didn't stay with them.",2025-08-29T17:31:14.402019300Z,a week ago

I am writing this on behalf of my guest who stayed at The Orion Hotel – Greater Kailash. Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing and truly a waste of money.
Here are the problems they faced during their stay:
1.	The room was not clean, and the washroom had a bad smell.
2.	The guest taken a suite room by paying extra, but the condition remained the same.  There was a strong  smell coming from bathroom. The exhaust fan was pushing the unpleasant air into the room after use.

3.	There was no proper service. The guest requested a water bottle, but no one responded. Even after repeated calls to the reception, no one came to provide water.

4.	On the last night, the guest asked for some sugar and salt due to a stomach issue (diarrhoea), but no staff was available to help.

5.	It seems the hotel needs to hire professional and trained staff. The reception staff was rude and careless and did not show any concern for the guest’s comfort.

Disappointing Stay: Poor Food, Cleanliness Issues, and Health Concerns
Rating: 1/5

I recently had the misfortune of staying at and was thoroughly disappointed with the experience. The hotel's poor food quality, cleanliness issues, and overall neglect for guest health and safety made my stay unbearable.

*Bad Food*
The food served at the hotel's restaurant was a letdown. The dishes lacked flavor, and the quality of ingredients was subpar.  tasted bland and unappetizing. The breakfast spread was equally disappointing

*Feeling Sickness*
Unfortunately, the food poisoning I suffered from the hotel's restaurant was the worst part of my stay. I had for dinner on the  night left me feeling queasy and sick recovering from the ordeal.

*Dirtiness*
The hotel's cleanliness standards were alarming. My room was dusty, and the bathroom had visible stains on the floor and walls. The bed sheets and towels were not changed regular The hotel's common areas, were equally dirty and poorly maintained.

*

Overall, my stay was a disaster. The hotel's poor food quality, cleanliness issues, and neglect for guest health and safety made it a place to avoid. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2024-12-31T06:01:31.412741Z,8 months ago

The hotel's staff welcomed me with warm smiles and were exceptionally friendly throughout my stay. They were attentive, always ready to assist with any requests, and ensured I felt at home. The rooms were clean and comfortable, adding to the pleasant stay.

However, there are a few areas that need improvement. For instance, water bottles were not provided in the rooms, which is a basic necessity for guests. Additionally, the restaurant food was overpriced and not particularly tasty. I would suggest that the hotel management focus on enhancing these aspects to better match the service quality with the pricing.

Overall, the staffing was quite attentive, the service was good, and the rooms were clean. Despite the few drawbacks, I recommend Hotel V Inn for visitors looking for a decent place to stay in Jaipur.",2024-07-19T05:48:45.877568Z,a year ago

jai164,jai164_r5,Atmajayita Roy Barman,1,"I recently stayed at Gostops Jaipur in March, and I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at a hostel. I’ve stayed at other Gostops locations in Udaipur, Goa, and Mumbai, and never encountered anything close to this level of disappointment.

First, the Wi-Fi was completely non-functional during my entire stay, which is unacceptable, especially for a place that markets itself as a modern, convenient option for travelers. It made it impossible to do anything that required an internet connection.

To make matters worse, my friend fell ill, and we needed urgent help to get some medicine from a nearby chemist around 11-12 pm. We approached the staff for assistance, but there was no support or concern shown for our situation. We were left to fend for ourselves in a distressing situation with no empathy or care from the hotel staff.

The most shocking part of our stay, however, was the condition of the room. It was absolutely disgusting. The cleanliness was appalling, and it made our stay unbearable. I’ve stayed in multiple Gostops locations before, and I’ve never experienced such poor standards.

I expected much better from a brand I’ve trusted in the past. I will not be returning to Gostops Jaipur and cannot recommend this location to anyone. This experience has been completely unacceptable, and I sincerely hope the management takes immediate action to address these issues.",2025-03-24T12:29:30.456861Z,5 months ago
jai165,jai165_r1,Samarth Jain,1,"Worst hotel one could ever stay in
1. We tried calling them to ask for early checkin, firstly they didn’t pick call and then the number wasn’t reachable. So we reached hotel directly where they charged 300₹ for 3hrs Even though it was mentioned on Goibobo booking that complimentary early checkin.
2. Firstly they’ve given a key of the room where someone was already staying. Upon opening the door I saw the luggage. Luckily people were not there in the room at that time (breach of privacy)
3. Then they’ve given another room key where the room was too smelly and dampness all over the walls.
4. The tube light & AC of the room was also not working. Also it doesn’t have a TV. Upon complaining they changed the room.
5. In third room finally we stayed. In this room also there was dampness. There was no water for half a day in washroom.
6. There was a big layer of dust in table and bed.
7. They used to turn off the AC from reception multiple times a day and turn it on only when we call them or visit reception.
8. Multiple times when we asked for RO water their worker said RO is not working and we need to purchase packaged water When I asked manager he said there is no problem with RO and he sent the water later on.
9. For our 3days of stay no one came for room cleaning and even the plates of the food we ordered remain in the passage as they didn’t picked it up from there as well.
10. The window of the room was broken and hot air was coming from there constantly. We were in fear what if a bird comes in.
11. Many of the switches of the rooms were either not working or broken.
12. Room lock wasn’t working when tried to lock from outside. Every time we go out we need to spent 10-15mins to lock the door.
13. On last day someone tried to open our door from outside multiple times early in the morning. It’s good that we used the latch on door. It’s a big safety concern.
14. Most of the time they do not pick the call on reception and the given mobile number also remains busy.

jai168,jai168_r1,Rajdeep Ghosh,1,"❌ Worst Experience at Hotel Reeve Inn, Jaipur – Avoid at All Costs!

I checked into Hotel Reeve Inn on 8th July, and it turned out to be one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

From the moment we arrived, it was clear that the staff had no understanding of basic hospitality. We were not even offered a single bottle of drinking water upon check-in. When we requested a place to dry our clothes, they bluntly said there’s no facility for that. Only after repeated requests and back-and-forth conversations did they grudgingly allow us to use a balcony in a room that was under renovation—hardly a proper solution.

We had also asked them to keep our luggage safely while we went for sightseeing. They agreed, but to our shock, when we returned, we found our luggage had been dumped on the floor, completely unattended, with zero security.

To make matters worse, we returned to the hotel completely drenched from rain, and not a single staff member offered us a towel or any assistance. It felt like we were completely on our own—no service, no courtesy, no care.

The entire experience left us frustrated and disappointed. This hotel lacks even the most basic sense of customer service and is clearly not interested in guest comfort or satisfaction.

⚠️ Future guests, beware! If you’re expecting a welcoming, helpful, or even mildly hospitable stay—this is NOT the place.",2025-07-08T14:26:10.694762890Z,2 months ago

jai175,jai175_r2,Alka Johar,4,"I recently stayed at this hotel and was initially greeted by Abhishek, who came across as quiet and reserved. However, my perception quickly changed over the course of my stay. Abhishek went above and beyond to accommodate visiting family members and even helped me locate a specific type of ice cream that’s not easily available locally—thank you, Abhishek, if you happen to read this!

The rooms are charmingly styled in a rustic, cottage-like aesthetic. Washed wood furnishings paired with Jaipur textile designs give the space a warm, traditional feel.

The restaurant was a standout. Despite the understated ambiance compared to larger brand-name hotels, the food far surpassed anything recommended by Google. Don’t be fooled by appearances—this place delivers quality and flavor. I highly recommend trying it.

Mr. Saurabh brings a refreshing sense of calm to the property. Together, he and Abhishek clearly live and breathe hospitality—they are the heart of the hotel.

The only drawbacks I experienced were the location, which doesn’t quite reflect the character of the hotel, and the unreliable internet. I had to rely on my mobile hotspot for most of my work.

Bedsheets are stained. Towels are akin to doormats. Furniture is blessed by Termites. ACs gives sound of turbine and the rooms smell of urine.

I feel bad for the people who work there as it’s not their fault and the 1 star in service is for the owner who is not willing to spend in maintaining the property.

I recently had the misfortune of staying at this hotel, and I strongly advise against it.

For a price range of 2-2.5k, there are numerous better options available. The hotel's website photos are outdated, and the property desperately needs maintenance.

Here are the issues I faced:

- No TV in the room
- No hairdryer
- No electric kettle
- Room was on the top floor with a balcony that had a direct tank overflow water problem
- Broken shower
- Pool area lacked umbrella shades
- No foot mat in the room

To add to the disappointment, the menu prices were exorbitantly high.

Overall, my stay was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

However, the charm was overshadowed by poor maintenance — everything felt dusty, and the balcony was extremely dirty.

While I appreciated the early check-in, the receptionist was not particularly friendly. The AC was noisy and didn’t cool properly, and the remote had no batteries. When I requested batteries, they took the remote and never returned it.

A major concern was receiving a text in the afternoon stating my booking was canceled after I had already checked in. When I called to clarify, they admitted it was a mistake and assured me my booking was secure.

On the bright side, their food was good, and the property is well-located. The rates are reasonable, but the lack of proper maintenance and service made the experience underwhelming.",2025-02-03T17:41:01.009907Z,7 months ago

They have no menu of food
I got Idli and Sambar & Chatni
Idli was smelling very bad
Chatni was frozen was not freshly cooked

Sambar was very bad it won't be tasted like sambar.

The location is ideal—just a few minutes from the airport, which made it super convenient for my travel schedule. The rooms are spacious, hygienic, and thoughtfully designed with modern amenities. The beds were very comfortable, and the overall ambiance was peaceful and relaxing.

What truly stood out was the hospitality. The staff were polite, responsive, and went out of their way to make sure we had a pleasant stay. Special thanks to the manager for being so accommodating and helpful throughout our visit.

The food was fresh and tasty, and the room service was prompt. It's clear that the management prioritizes guest comfort and cleanliness, and it really shows in every detail.

jai190,jai190_r2,Fresh Jinx,1,"Treebo The Anchorage in Jaipur is a budget-friendly hotel that stands out primarily for its excellent location, but several shortcomings significantly affect the overall guest experience.

Pros

The most notable advantage of Treebo The Anchorage is its strategic location in Malviya Nagar, close to key landmarks like Jaipur International Airport and Fortis Hospital. Guests consistently appreciate the convenience, with easy access to shopping areas and major roads, making it suitable for both leisure and business travelers. The rooms are generally described as clean, spacious, and equipped with basic amenities, offering good value for the price. Many reviewers have also highlighted the helpfulness and hospitality of the staff, which can enhance the comfort of your stay.

Cons

Despite its strengths, the hotel has several significant drawbacks. Parking is limited, which can be a hassle for those arriving by car—this is a recurring concern among guests.The complimentary breakfast is often criticized for its poor quality, with guests describing it as the ""worst breakfast"" and noting that the spread is minimal and sometimes unappetizing.The lack of variety and freshness suggests that the complimentary nature of the meal may be affecting standards, and it is an area where Treebo’s administration needs urgent attention.

Another major issue is the inconsistency in toiletries. Only basic bath soap is provided, with no shampoo, moisturizer, or other essentials, which is surprising given that other Treebo properties often offer a more complete set of amenities. This lack of uniformity in standards across the Treebo chain is disappointing and confusing for regular customers. Additionally, maintenance seems to be a recurring problem: bath fittings are sometimes broken or poorly maintained, and there is little effort from the staff to address or update these issues[1]. The in-room tea/coffee maker is frequently reported to be dirty and appears to have been neglected for years, further detracting from the overall comfort and hygiene of the stay.

Conclusion

Treebo The Anchorage offers a great location and decent rooms at an affordable price, but it falls short in several key areas such as parking, breakfast quality, toiletries, and maintenance. These issues, if addressed, could greatly improve the guest experience. Until then, travelers seeking a hassle-free stay with consistent amenities and better upkeep may want to consider alternatives in the area.",2025-05-22T06:14:16.522137Z,3 months ago

Highly recommended for anyone looking for comfort, cleanliness, and quality service. Will definitely visit again! 💯✨",2025-07-25T05:13:32.413593240Z,a month ago

The experience was terrible.
First of all didn't started in built music system for the first hour of function, most of the people were not aware how to start that.
Second - We requested for two rooms for 1 hour , at first they said during booking We will open it no issues, and didn't asked for any extra charges.
But while checkout they charged Rs. 1800 per room, quoting that's the price of per room no matter you take for one hour or whole day.
Third - The promised items with approved list had butter scotch icecream as well in the list and they forgot to put it on table during function and was not given to guest.

I will strongly suggest to not go there for any family functions as they will not fulfill there promises at last moments but they will talk to you so nicely during booking that you will trust them like they are so good people

There room size is very small.

They said during booking sir we will give you super deluxe room, no worries.
But that room is generally under deluxe will very small size.

Avoid such hotels, full of scam, highly suggested.

jai197,jai197_r3,**,1,"I am writing to share my recent experience during my stay at Anjushree Inn from April 30 to May 3, 2025, as I believe it is important to inform others about the challenges I faced.

Upon my arrival at night, I was allocated a room that was not properly cleaned. Dust covered the desks, bed headboard, ceiling fans, air conditioner ducts, and television. I immediately requested a room change, but the receptionist refused, stating that since I booked through Goibibo, I needed to contact them for assistance.

Throughout the night, I discovered that the air conditioner was not functioning. When I brought this to the attention of the receptionist again, he reiterated that a room change was not possible. To make matters worse, I experienced a power outage that made my stay unbearable. The unpleasant smell in the room and the poorly maintained drainage system only added to my discomfort. The staff continued to direct me to Goibibo for any concerns related to my booking, leaving me without support during my stay.

Additionally, I ordered food from the hotel’s restaurant, only to find that many items on the menu were unavailable, but they still charged me the full price. When I requested a bill or invoice, the staff claimed that their printer was not functioning. After persistent insistence, they eventually provided an invoice with incorrect check-in and check-out dates, including a fraudulent GST number. I later received a correct GST invoice after further verification.

Given these numerous inconveniences and the overall lack of professionalism demonstrated by the hotel staff and management, I cannot recommend Anjushree Inn to anyone considering a stay there.",2025-05-06T10:02:45.471559Z,4 months ago

jai200,jai200_r1,Sanjay Maurya,1,"I had a terrible experience at FabHotel Dream Palace, Jaipur. The condition of the room was absolutely shocking. There were rats inside the room – not just one, but multiple sightings. That itself was enough to ruin the stay. On top of that, the room was full of cigarette smell, and there was dirt everywhere – under the bed, in the corners, even the bathroom was not properly cleaned.

It was obvious that hygiene and cleanliness are not a priority at this place. The bedsheets did not feel fresh, and the entire atmosphere of the room was unhygienic and uncomfortable. Honestly, it did not feel safe or livable, especially if someone is travelling with family or elderly people.

For a hotel that claims to offer decent budget accommodation, this was completely unacceptable. Whether it was poor maintenance or just complete carelessness, the condition of the room was far below basic standards.

jai200,jai200_r3,Navneet Suthar,5,"Nestled inside the Treebo Dream Palace hotel in Sanganer, Jaipur, the Dream Restaurant is the on-site casual-dining option serving strictly pure vegetarian North Indian cuisine, with Jain dishes also available  ￼ ￼. It opens for breakfast (8–10 AM), lunch (1–3 PM), and dinner (7–11 PM)  ￼.

✅ Positive Highlights
•	Breakfast spread is complimentary and includes a modest selection of North Indian vegetarian dishes—ideal as a quick start to the day. Many guests found it sufficient, though not lavish  ￼ ￼.
•	Restaurant convenience is a standout: located within the property, it’s helpful after a long journey or for guests who prefer not to venture outside late at night.
•	Several reviews praised the taste of food as “excellent” despite overall budget lodging, especially in relation to value travellers value posture of dining included with stay  ￼.

⚠️ Areas for Improvement
•	The quantity of food—especially during dinner—often felt skimpy for families. One guest described meals as “not enough for one family of two,” asking them to consider better options elsewhere  ￼.
•	Ratings for food quality compiled via MyTrip average at just 3.3/5, lower than location or service scores—suggesting inconsistency or limited choices in menu items  ￼.
•	Cleanliness concerns tied to the overall hotel—such as dusty washrooms or mismanaged room upkeep—sometimes extended to the dining area experience, dampening impressions  ￼.

🧂 Menu Style & Suitability
•	The cuisine remains conservative and north-Indian focused—good for simple meals when you’re weary—but less satisfying for guests craving richer flavours or Rajasthani specialities.
•	Jain food availability is a thoughtful addition for dietary needs.",2025-07-30T04:37:46.756844776Z,a month ago

That very morning we were told to check out. When we booked, we mentioned we are probably going to stay for longer and we need at least one day notice of a check out, like they need.

My one-night stay was a nightmare. The hotel was filthy, with torn bed linen that wasn't washed despite multiple uses. The washroom was disgustingly dirty, and dust coated every surface in the room. The AC malfunctioned, and stained chairs added to the misery.

The staff seemed disorganized, and the online pictures were misleading, showcasing a newly constructed building that no longer reflects the current state.

Despite paying a premium, basic amenities like soap and toothpaste were missing. The included breakfast was unthinkable due to the hotel's unhygienic conditions.

But when I reached the property, they completely changed the price to ₹2000 and claimed that the call was picked up by the room service staff and not the official receptionist — very unprofessional and misleading.

We enjoyed all the meals and Nadya was so kind that she also asked if we wanted any special dish.

Yusuf, her husband, was always there to serve the food and have very interesting conversations. He knows a lot about the city and every kind of tourist recommendation.

We will miss Nadya Homestay for sure, thanks a lot guys for making us feel at home 🌞",2024-12-17T09:10:11.795521Z,8 months ago
jai226,jai226_r2,Pablo Feito,5,"A True Home Away From Home

We stayed at Nadya Homestay for two months, and it was an unforgettable experience. My colleague and I—both journalists—were working with Nadya’s husband, Yusuf, a renowned anthropologist specializing in nomadic tribes. From the moment we arrived, Nadya and Yusuf made us feel completely at home.

Nadya is an incredible chef. I used to think vegetarian food was boring until I tasted her cooking. She always buys fresh vegetables and meat and prepares amazing, homemade meals, with freshly made roti bread. She even shared some of her traditional Indian recipes with us.

Yusuf knows Jaipur city very well. He was always there to help us with anything we needed, from information about the city to recommendations for cheap souvenir shops, local activities, and hidden gems (literally we bought emeralds).

The homestay itself is perfect if you’re looking for comfort and warmth. The house is very clean, and they have both AC and heating, ensuring a pleasant stay with hot showers year-round. The rooftop is a wonderful space for morning workouts or peaceful meditation sessions.

Nadya Homestay truly reflects one of the most beautiful aspects of Indian culture: the value of family. It is a peaceful, welcoming, and comfortable place to stay, and it quickly became our home away from home.

We highly recommend Nadya Homestay and can’t wait to visit again!",2024-12-17T09:34:52.606870Z,8 months ago

They have seating arrangement, functional microwave in the kitchen.

They provide 1 lt water complimentary

Cons were that they charged same for the room with attached toilet and one with common toilet. Charges were on the higher side- 1500/- for the facilities provided.

Also, Goibibo didn't help at all. They kept telling me they would call me back and the never did. It's so sad that there are so many cheaters here.

They responded to this review below but don’t believe them. I literally received emails where they told me they will not refund me. They continue lying just to look good on here. And, they definitely discriminate on nationality, hence I wasn’t allowed to stay.

I recently had the misfortune of staying at Hotel Holiday Home in Jaipur, and my experience was extremely disappointing. The hotel failed to provide even basic amenities and cleanliness.

*Major Issues:*

- Unclean rooms and common areas
- Non-functional flush in the toilet
- No locks on bathroom doors
- Dirty bed sheets
- Outdated, poorly maintained rooms
- Subpar service from staff

*Unacceptable Experience:*

For a hotel claiming to provide comfortable accommodations, Holiday Home fell woefully short. The lack of attention to cleanliness and maintenance made my stay unpleasant. The service was unresponsive and unhelpful.

*Travelers Beware:*

If you value your comfort and hygiene, I would strongly advise against staying at Hotel Holiday Home, Jaipur. There are far better options available in the city.

*Rating Breakdown:*

- Cleanliness: 1/5
- Maintenance: 1/5
- Service: 1.5/5
- Value for Money: 1/5

jai239,jai239_r2,MANOHAR Jhariya,5,"I visited this hotel with family from 24 March to 25 March . I was on personal visit from Mumbai to mehandipur balaji temple. On the way to metro station from jaipur railway station I noticed this hotel,  and I decided to stay at this hotel on returning from Balaji temple.  Really this decision of mine proved to be good. This was comfortable and convenient stay for me. The room and the bathroom were clean and well maintained , pillow and bedsheet were clean. Smart TV in the room. My daughter enjoyed it. The food of the hotel restaurant was delicious, tasty. Two days after leaving the home, we ate so much delicious food at reasonable price. I enjoyed this testy food 3 times during our 24 hours stay. One of the best thing is that, this hotel is just two minutes walking distance from jaipur railway station and just below the metro station. Mr sushil sharma (owner) is very humble also all the staff of this hotel is very helpful and polite.  If anyone has problem with WC in the bathroom, they allow to use outside bathroom attached with lC. Staying in this hotel was our best experience, very safe for family.

jai239,jai239_r4,Vivek Karmakar,5,"I am writing this review not because the people at the hotel did any favor to me but to help people to choose a right hotel to stay to make their trip comfortable and memorable. I booked room no 119 for two days from 11.03.25 to 12.03.25. Here is the detailed review -

1. The room and the bathroom were clean and well maintained. The room was well lit and ventilation of the room is really good. Pillow, bed sheet and every material provided in the room was clean and hygienic. The smart TV in the room works.

2. It is just 2 mins walk from the Jaipur station and only 100 mts to be specific. The room was not noisy.

3. It is just opposite to the police station and therefore you don't need to think about safety.

4. The railway station, metro station, bus stand all are in walking distance. All the necessary shops are nearby.

5. The hotel is running a restaurant for the guests. The food is tasty and price is reasonable. The same quality food will cost much outside. The sitting place of the restaurant is clean and spacious. The reception is also very spacious.

6. The best part of this hotel is the people running it. Two elderly people and one mid aged man (probably Sureshji) was in the reception in different time. All are very welcoming and helpful. The attendant and cook Ramraj bhai is very polite.

The atmosphere of the hotel is calm and it runs without any chaos. We traveled Rajasthan for 12 days and stayed in different budget hotels. Staying in this hotel was our best experience. People traveling with family will love this place.

N.B. The rooms you see in the picture look exactly like that. This is probably a new property. If you are in jaipur, and searching for a comfortable stay, go for it.",2025-03-13T10:15:19.375146Z,5 months ago

jai244,jai244_r3,Pankaj Singh Gill,1,"We recently booked a stay at this property through OYO, having prepaid based on the appealing photos online. Unfortunately, the reality was far from the expectations set by the images. Here's our experience:

No Parking Facility: Upon arrival with my family, we discovered there was no parking available. This was the first inconvenience, setting the tone for what followed.

Check-in Before Room Inspection: The staff took our IDs and checked us in without showing us the rooms. When we were finally shown the rooms, they were in an appalling state.

Unhygienic Rooms: The first two rooms presented were filthy. The bedsheets had visible stains and liquids, the washrooms were dirty, and there was a strong, unpleasant odor. Upon complaining, we were shown two more rooms, which were no better.

Documented Neglect: We took photos as evidence of the horrifying conditions—broken toilet seats, cigarette butts in supposedly ""cleaned"" rooms, a pervasive irritating smell, spit marks on the mirror, dirty bed corners, torn towels, overused bedsheets, and broken electrical outlets. The overall environment was unsanitary and unsafe.

OYO Customer Care Fails Customers: When we decided not to stay in this uninhabitable hotel and reported the issues to OYO support, we were extremely disappointed. Instead of addressing our concerns, the customer care executive prioritized the hotel manager’s claims over the photo proof we submitted. They even claimed the manager was “willing to help” when this was not the case.

No Refund Despite Non-Stay: Despite the conditions and proof of neglect, OYO refused to issue a refund for a stay we didn’t even take. We ultimately drove 350 km back home with a 2-year-old child after a tiring day of travel, as staying in such an unsafe and hazardous property was not an option.

Privacy and Security Breach: After the call with OYO customer care was disconnected, the property manager directly called my wife's personal number, which had been used during booking. This was highly unprofessional and a serious breach of privacy. How does OYO ensure the safety and security of its customers in such cases?

Overall, this experience has left us deeply dissatisfied with both the hotel and OYO’s service. The lack of accountability, the poor customer care response, and the failure to address our concerns raise serious questions about OYO's commitment to providing a safe and pleasant stay for its customers.

We strongly urge OYO to reconsider its policies, take strict action against such properties, and improve its customer support system. For now, this will remain one of our worst travel experiences.

I will surely escalate this matter to OYO leadership to determine what comes next.",2025-01-22T00:04:58.543101Z,7 months ago
jai244,jai244_r4,Pankaj Gill,1,"Dear Fellow Travelers,

I want to bring to your attention a concerning issue I have observed with one of the hotels listed on the OYO platform. It seems this hotel is involved in malpractice, such as manipulating reviews and surveys through fake and misleading feedback.

Before booking, I strongly encourage you to take a close look at the reviews for this property, especially the five-star ones. Most of them are from accounts like ""Rahull,"" ""Kuldeep,"" ""Sanjay,"" etc., with random pictures or irrelevant text. Some even mention amenities like bouquets, pools, or gyms that don’t exist at the hotel, clearly indicating they are copied or fabricated.

The OYO algorithm seems to automatically prioritize five-star reviews, which pushes genuine feedback further down. This can easily fool real customers like us. Additionally, there are signs that some bookings marked as “pay later” are being falsely flagged as paid by hotel staff to boost the ratings.

Is it even legal to manipulate reviews and mislead customers like this? Such practices not only deceive potential guests but also harm the credibility of platforms like OYO.

I am posting this here to warn others in case OYO management overlooks this issue. Please do your due diligence and thoroughly check reviews before booking any property.

Stay vigilant and book wisely!",2025-01-23T18:17:08.089705Z,7 months ago

jai249,jai249_r1,Akshay Dwivedi,1,"Owner had helping nature but it seems that rooms near Station are pathetic when it comes to cost on service ratio. A room booked online for 560₹ didn't had bedsheets cleaned . Firstly they tried to change the room to adjoining hotel of theirs but it seems the hotels are not well maintained. Book wisely, don't book as per Google ratings.
Better to find hotel offline ,after conforming the room quality and then bargaining with the price.",2021-09-11T01:27:16.288389Z,3 years ago
