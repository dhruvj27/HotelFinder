The lobby appeared uninviting due to its dull lighting however the looming centerpiece statue was impressive. The carpet covering the corridors were dirty and old. The doors looked like dormitory ones, they entrance to the rooms should exude luxury which it lacked. I booked a room with balcony however the view was of the back side of a building. I understand you can't get scenic views in a city however this balcony served me no purpose except for drying my socks. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had a good night's sleep so 5/5 on that. The bathroom had a tub which was a plus point. The breakfast spread had variety and the chef at the live counter prepared a very delicious omelet for me. I enjoyed my meal and would come back for it.

It was the only part of the stay that felt like it belonged in a higher-rated hotel.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else fell flat. The rooms were shockingly small, barely enough space to walk around the bed as compared to it was priced at.\n\nWorse still, the air-conditioning was a nightmare. The room remained uncomfortably warm and stuffy throughout my stay, with no proper airflow. To make matters worse, the temperature setting couldn\u2019t be reduced below 21\u00b0C, which made it almost suffocating and unable to sleep the whole night.\n\nThis hotel might work if you\u2019re just dropping by for breakfast lunch or dinner, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for a stay.

I worked strange hours and was hoping for more late dining options besides a big buffet at 10pm. I asked about the bar, thinking I could get a small bite, but they point in the direction of the main restaurant and although I asked twice, no one thought to explain how to get there beyond pointing from the lobby to the restaurant. I prefer the larger hotels with multiple options for food. One night I ordered room service which was fine, but they couldn't bring me a cocktail and they couldn't tell me why or what they could bring, just that they didn't have what I was asking for, so I don't know if it was time or policy or selection (I asked for 2-3 different options to make sure it wasn't an ingredient).

You feel welcome and well taken care of from the moment you arrive. Some staff members even spoke a little French, which added a fun and friendly touch to the experience.\n\nThe rooms and common areas are clean and well maintained. Of course, there's always room for improvement, but it\u2019s already very good and more than comfortable for a long stay. If any small issues came up, the staff was quick to respond, which is much appreciated.\n\nA few points could be improved:\n\nThe gym is a bit outdated.\n\nThe pool is nice, but not well-oriented for sun exposure, so the water is quite cold.\n\nThe rooftop was not accessible. It\u2019s been closed for several years I think, which was a real disappointment, especially since I was looking forward to enjoying it.\n\nThe hotel is located a bit off the main road, on a small side street. The upside is that it\u2019s peaceful, with no traffic noise. However, since the hotel is quite far from downtown Bangalore, you should expect about an hour\u2019s drive if you want to enjoy the city\u2019s atmosphere and activities. On the positive side, the location is convenient for the airport and for nearby business areas, which was ideal in my case.\n\nI want to sincerely thank all the hotel staff. I won\u2019t mention any names here, for fear of forgetting someone, but everyone\u2014from the reception to the bar and restaurant\u2014will recognize themselves. Thank you for your kindness and professionalism.\n\nI truly enjoyed my six-week stay at this hotel. Thanks again to all the teams!",

After 10:30 AM, they refused to serve even a single cup of tea, which was quite frustrating.\n\nThere are no nearby shops either for tea or other basic needs, which made it even more inconvenient. The staff seemed very rigid about check-out and breakfast timings, which didn\u2019t leave a great impression. Honestly, I didn\u2019t like this place much.\n\nThe only good thing is that it\u2019s located near MG Road, so it's convenient for going out and enjoying places like Hangover.

The breakfast, lunch, and dinner were absolutely delicious, and the hot toddy was exactly what I needed. That special note was the sweetest touch!\n\nIt truly felt like being cared for by an extended family. Thank you for creating such a warm and welcoming environment.

Unfortunately, the experience was far from what we expected for an international hotel with 4 Star rating. The experience was horrible.\n\n1. The air conditioning in 2x rooms was completely non-functional, making it extremely uncomfortable, especially for children. Whereas 1x room AC was super chilled, something wrong with thermostats. We reported the issue to the management and no action was taken.\n2. Additionally, all room keys consistently failed, causing further inconvenience every time we tried to access our rooms.\n3. Clogged washrooms, broken flush panels resulted in not flushing the Pee and Poop properly. The technician came with plunger to unclogged the feces from WC. Attached pictures as proof.\n4. Rusty and fungus in washrooms, unhygienic towels as if it\u2019s in a 2 Star hotel. Cannot be compared with a 4 Star hotel.\n5. Sticky plywood flooring in bedroom. It\u2019s not mopped properly. One room has broken flooring.\n\nFor the price paid, this experience was unacceptable. It\u2019s clear that the hotel has a serious and ongoing problem with its air conditioning system, maintenance issues, house keeping problems.\n\nWe strongly advise others to avoid this hotel. It was a nightmare for us, and certainly not worth the cost. I\u2019m happy to share more information and feedback to owners, visitors and travel agents. There was multiple complaints since many months and management just acknowledges the feedback but no action was taken. And i\u2019m sure this will also be nicely declined with a polite response.",

The staff is so nice and caring they really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. They even checked up on me everyday while I was sick. I really enjoyed the breakfast every morning where I used to get my morning coffee the way I want it without even asking for it. I also really appreciated the reception staff who gives you the warmest welcome. I also never really felt the need to go to a Salon outside the hotel campus as the tattva spa is fabulous. The rooms are so well equipped and if you need anything extra thats taken care off as well. I look forward to staying there again.
