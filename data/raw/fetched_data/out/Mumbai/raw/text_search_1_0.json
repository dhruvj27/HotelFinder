It was not only unpleasant to look at but also affected the overall feel of the room. Additionally, since the room was on a lower floor facing another building, we had to keep our curtains closed all the time to maintain privacy \u2014 which completely defeated the purpose of a relaxing, well-lit room.\n\nI spoke with a representative over the phone who assured me that the team would call me back regarding the room change \u2014 no one ever did. I also raised the issue at the reception counter and while the staff there was willing to help, by then half of my stay was already over, making the change pointless.\n\nAnother concern was the food pricing and quantity. While I understand and accept premium pricing at such properties, the portion sizes were surprisingly small \u2014 not sufficient even for two people. If the prices are on the higher end, then the quantity should justify it.\n\nOverall, apart from the entrance and lobby area which gives a five-star impression, the rest of the experience did not live up to the standards one would expect from such a property. Basic guest comfort and proactive service were clearly lacking.\n\nI hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on addressing these issues \u2014 both in terms of room allocation transparency and service responsiveness.",

The breakfast is also average and so are the other facilities, swimming pool is also average and not so great. The lifts were smelling with some smoking like smell, the staff was rarely smiling and seems to be least bothered.\nOverall experience is a kind of 2/5 star, don't expect any feel of a luxury hotel and expect a slightly upper than the normal budget hotel, as the Novotel Brand may sound very luxury but this property is no where close to its standards.",

The location is truly stunning, offering breathtaking views of the Arabian Sea and the iconic Worli Sea Link. Our room was incredibly spacious and well-appointed with all the luxury amenities one could desire. The staff were consistently polite and provided top-notch hospitality throughout our stay.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the beautifully designed kids' area. The inclusion of the small rabbit enclosure, fish pond, and bird area was a unique and delightful touch that our children absolutely loved. It created a wonderful atmosphere for them. Staying here felt like an escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai, allowing us to spend quality time with our family in a serene and luxurious setting. We highly recommend the Taj Lands End for a memorable and rejuvenating experience.",

I was given one room around 2pm which was a twin bed, while I had booked for a King bed. My family was sitting in the allotted room for almost 2 hours uncomfortably. After much follow up, I was given one room with king bed and had again to wait for another room for a while. Finally I got second room around 3.45 pm.I had plans to take rest and go for a swim in the pool, but because of the delayed check in, all my plans went for a toss. One of the rooms allotted had an uncleaned window therby obstructing the sea view for which I had specifically booked.\n\nNext day morning, for breakfast at 9.30 am, there were 15 people waiting in the line outside the restaurant. We were asked to go to the other restaurant below. I had asked for a table for 5 which was given with 5 chairs and  only 4 table mats. Had to again wait for sometime requesting them to put the mat and the cutlery. Most of the food items were not even warm. Taste was just so so. Had to wait for bowls for sambar.\n\nOverall, our high expectations of a great weekend at a reputed hotel was not satisfactory.",

The rooms are well designed and love that the shower has a door and a high divider so water doesn\u2019t spill out when taking a shower. Breakfast is a FULL LUXURY experience with endless options catering to multicultural taste palettes and each item is authentically cooked.

A small suggestion for improvement would be consistent temperature across different spaces and perhaps a bit more attention to non spicy food requirements by in room dining which was fixed immediately after mentioned.

I must say - this hotel was one of the rare experiences in India I've had where the services and amenities offered were of international standards (reminded me of my time in Singapore!).\n\nThe entire hotel and the rooms were clean and tidy, the room service crew were pleasant in nature. The room design and bathroom were elegant with a yellow aesthetic touch to it. Special shout out to Mr. Santosh Bait who kept cleaning my room everyday even when I forgot to put the tag outside my room.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was the best that I could ask for. After ordering the same item for 2-3 days, Mr. Nousadh understood to prepare it just by my gentle nod. Also the dinners that were covered under the plan were delicious. I must have tried 10 different items and all of them were top-notch.\n\nOverall opinion - Strongly recommended \ud83d\udc9b",

That\u2019s why I chose it again for a special celebration \u2014 our birthday and anniversary stay.\n\nThis time, I booked over a phone call and clearly mentioned our wish for a full sea view room. Unfortunately, the staff didn\u2019t communicate the room details properly. We ended up with a partial view, and worse \u2014 the window was dirty, making the view even less enjoyable. Despite informing the reception, no action was taken, which was disappointing for a returning guest on a special occasion.\n\nThat said, there were some clear highlights:\n\u2022\tThe spa was exceptional \u2014 from the sauna, steam, cold bath, whirlpool jacuzzi, to the relaxation room, everything was serene, clean, and truly therapeutic. The staff there deserves appreciation for their warm and attentive service.\n\u2022\tThe swimming pool was another plus \u2014 especially the saltwater pool, which was a refreshing and unique experience.\n\u2022\tThe breakfast spread was fantastic \u2014 a great mix of Indian and international options, fresh fruits, juices, live counters, and excellent coffee. A perfect start to the morning.\n\nOverall, while parts of the stay were memorable, the room experience and lack of proactive service left us a little let down \u2014 especially as returning guests celebrating something personal. Still, the property has its charm, and hopefully, with better communication, future stays can be closer to the standard we once loved.",

The fried rice and chilly chicken was far worse than a road side thela.. the chicken was so hard that we could play ping pong with it and it would bounce back.

I went to see the room and they were asking 2800 for a room which is supposedly deluxe. The rooms are horrible now and they are dirty. Totally not worth the price you pay for it. Rather pay 2k or 3k more and stay in a better room. Ever since Management changed I believe they just want to scam now I was so angry when I saw the room they were originally giving me cause I have stayed here before and for lesser I was given way better rooms. Absolutely worst experience. Toilet flush does not work AC is would work at times. I am sorry but I am never going to visit here ever again. Ending my relation with this hotel for good.",

The spread, freshness, and flavors were top-tier. A must-experience.\n\u2022\tCleanliness & Amenities: Rooms were spotless, beds comfortable, and all amenities including spa, sauna, and swimming pool were well-managed and relaxing.\n\u2022\tLocation: You really can\u2019t beat it \u2014 central, premium, and peaceful.\n\u2022\tSpecial Mention: Paaji (Doorman/Host): A true gem! Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That\u2019s the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.\n\n\u274c Where things fell flat:\n\u2022\tCustomer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival \u2014 but received no response, and none of the requests were honored.\n\u2022\tCheck-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch. It felt like we were just another room number to him \u2014 not the Leela standard at all.\n\u2022\tRoom Allocation: The main reason I booked Leela was for the view over the swimming pool, and it wasn\u2019t provided even after communicating it in advance.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Final Thoughts:\n\nThe property is absolutely worth experiencing \u2014 beautiful interiors, relaxing amenities, and standout hospitality by individuals like Paaji.\nBut the front desk team and guest communication need serious improvement if The Leela wants to continue being a name that stands for luxury.\n\nWill I return? Maybe \u2014 but I\u2019ll think twice, and only after ensuring better pre-arrival communication.",

A must-experience.\n\u2022\tCleanliness & Amenities: Rooms were spotless, beds comfortable, and all amenities including spa, sauna, and swimming pool were well-managed and relaxing.\n\u2022\tLocation: You really can\u2019t beat it \u2014 central, premium, and peaceful.\n\u2022\tSpecial Mention: Paaji (Doorman/Host): A true gem! Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That\u2019s the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.\n\n\u274c Where things fell flat:\n\u2022\tCustomer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival \u2014 but received no response, and none of the requests were honored.\n\u2022\tCheck-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch. It felt like we were just another room number to him \u2014 not the Leela standard at all.\n\u2022\tRoom Allocation: The main reason I booked Leela was for the view over the swimming pool, and it wasn\u2019t provided even after communicating it in advance.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Final Thoughts:\n\nThe property is absolutely worth experiencing \u2014 beautiful interiors, relaxing amenities, and standout hospitality by individuals like Paaji.\nBut the front desk team and guest communication need serious improvement if The Leela wants to continue being a name that stands for luxury.\n\nWill I return? Maybe \u2014 but I\u2019ll think twice, and only after ensuring better pre-arrival communication.",

These establishments do not merely provide a place to stay; they offer an unparalleled experience that elevates hospitality to an art form. A five-star hotel is characterized by meticulous attention to detail, exceptional amenities, and an ability to anticipate guests' needs long before they arise.\n\nImagine walking into a five-star hotel lobby; the ambiance bathes you in elegance, with marble floors, exquisite chandeliers, and tasteful artwork adorning the walls. The professional staff greets you with warm smiles, ready to cater to your needs. A five-star hotel prides itself on providing personalized service, with staff trained to deliver service that goes beyond expectations. Whether it\u2019s a welcome drink upon arrival, a personalized note in your room, or custom-made itineraries, every element is thoughtfully curated to make you feel valued and pampered.\n\nAccommodations in five-star hotels are nothing short of spectacular. Spacious rooms and suites often come with stunning views, luxurious furnishings, and the latest technology. High-end bedding, plush robes, and well-stocked minibars create an oasis of comfort. Many hotels also offer private balconies, hot tubs, or even dedicated butler services to ensure every guest's desires are met. The bathrooms in these establishments are typically lavish, featuring high-end toiletries, rain showers, and deep soaking tubs, transforming everyday routines into indulgent rituals.\n\nGastronomy in five-star hotels is a standout feature. Renowned chefs craft menus that blend local flavors with international cuisine, using the freshest ingredients sourced from nearby markets. Many of these hotels boast award-winning restaurants, often with Michelin stars, offering guests gourmet dining experiences. Whether it\u2019s a lavish breakfast buffet, a light lunch by the pool, or a multi-course dinner with wine pairings, dining becomes an unforgettable journey of flavors.\n\nWellness is another critical aspect of five-star accommodations. Most feature full-service spas, state-of-the-art fitness centers, and serene swimming pools, providing guests the opportunity to relax and rejuvenate. Spa treatments often include signature massages, beauty therapies, and holistic wellness practices designed to promote relaxation and balance. Additionally, many hotels offer bespoke wellness programs, from yoga sessions on the beach to guided nature walks, ensuring guests can unwind both physically and mentally.\n\nMeeting and event facilities in five-star hotels are tailored to host everything from intimate gatherings to grand celebrations. With elegant ballrooms, state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment, and dedicated event planners, these venues ensure that every occasion is memorable. Business travelers benefit from fully equipped meeting rooms and concierge services, making work and leisure seamlessly intertwined.\n\nFinally, the location of a five-star hotel often enhances its allure. Positioned in prime areas\u2014be it a bustling city center, a serene beach, or a scenic mountain\u2014guests can easily explore the surrounding attractions, cultural sites, and natural beauty. The combination of luxurious accommodations, exceptional service, and prime location ensures that a stay at a five-star hotel is more than just a getaway; it\u2019s an experience that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nIn summary, a five-star hotel is an epitome of luxury and refinement. From personalized service and exquisite accommodations to world-class dining and wellness experiences, these establishments offer an escape into a world of unparalleled comfort and elegance. For those seeking a unique blend of relaxation and indulgence, five-star hotels stand as a beacon of hospitality excellence.",

Though the rates are on the higher side but that's what you pay for all the services which you get at Taj! Another fine property which checks all the boxes. Huge room, lovely view, great food and hospitality! Banquet rooms are quite huge and great for business and personal ceremonies! Great location is a cherry on the cake!\n\nPhotos from August 2019 stay",

I also had the opportunity to enjoy a few meals at the hotel's restaurant, and each dish was expertly prepared and presented.\n\nThe hotel's location near the international airport was incredibly convenient, especially for business travelers like myself. The efficient shuttle service provided by the hotel made it easy to navigate between the airport and the hotel, saving me valuable time. Despite its proximity to the airport, I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet and peaceful the hotel was, allowing me to unwind after a long day.\n\nAdditionally, the Hilton Mumbai International Airport hotel offers a range of amenities that further enhanced my stay. The fitness center was well-equipped, allowing me to maintain my exercise routine while traveling. The swimming pool provided a refreshing escape from the bustling city, and the spa offered a range of rejuvenating treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Hilton Mumbai International Airport hotel. It is a true gem that combines world-class hospitality, impeccable service, and luxurious accommodations. Whether you're visiting Mumbai for business or leisure, this hotel will undoubtedly exceed your expectations. I look forward to returning to the Hilton Mumbai International Airport on my next trip to this vibrant city\n\nThanks for the service \ud83d\ude0d",

What truly elevated our experience was deciding to have lunch at the in-house restaurant. The buffet spread was truly luscious. Despite not planning to have soup that day, I followed the staff's recommendations and tried Khousuey, which was simply amazing. They also kindly served me a soybean soup to taste, which exceeded our expectations. Every dish was fantastic, and the desserts were absolutely mouthwatering. The green tea lime and mango pastry was superb. I've never had any issues with this hotel chain until now, but the experience here in Mumbai has truly won over my heart.

The check-in process was seamless, with warm and attentive staff ensuring a smooth arrival. My room was elegantly designed, impeccably clean, and featured a plush bed, excellent city views, fast Wi-Fi, and a well-appointed bathroom with premium toiletries. The breakfast buffet offered an extensive selection of fresh local and international options, and the rooftop AER lounge provided a stunning panoramic view of Mumbai\u2019s skyline, perfect for unwinding in the evening. The hotel\u2019s central location made commuting to business meetings and exploring the city convenient.

My sister and I had taken our aged parents to visit Mumbai for old times sake (they lived in Mumbai for 40+ years before relocating to the south). We were a little anxious how it would turn out since none of us had been to Mumbai in ages but we realized we made the right choice, as soon as we checked in at The Leela!!\nFrom the smooth checkin, the delicious food at Great Wall and Citrus and the SPECTACULAR HOSPITALITY by the staff, through out our stay, made this trip memorable. I was a little concerned that the hotel might be a little dated and not up to modern standards but those fears were soon laid to rest. The hotel is maintained meticulously and the decor is ageless. I am just amazed at the cleanliness and overall attention to detail.\n\nThank you to the wonderful staff at the Leela. We hope to come back soon!",
