Here's a review based on common experiences, tailored to a stay with your wife:\nA Romantic Getaway at The St. Regis Mumbai\nMy wife and I recently had the pleasure of staying at The St. Regis Mumbai, and it was a truly exceptional experience. From the moment we stepped into the elegant lobby, we were enveloped in a sense of luxury and warmth that made our romantic getaway feel incredibly special.\nThe location is a definite highlight. Situated in Lower Parel, it's a great base for exploring the city, and the direct connection to the Phoenix Palladium mall is a huge plus. We enjoyed the convenience of having high-end shops, a variety of dining options, and entertainment right at our fingertips, without even having to step outside.\nOur room was a sanctuary of comfort and style. The city views were breathtaking, and the plush, high-quality bedding and thoughtful amenities made it easy to relax and unwind. The bathrooms are particularly impressive, with luxurious marble, rainfall showers, and deep-soaking bathtubs that were perfect for a relaxing evening. The attention to detail in the housekeeping was also commendable, with the room kept spotless throughout our stay.\nThe service is where The St. Regis truly shines. The personalized butler service is a standout feature, and our butler was incredibly attentive and proactive, anticipating our needs and making sure every request was met. The staff across the hotel were friendly, welcoming, and professional, and many guests have noted that they went above and beyond to make their stay memorable. We felt like royalty from start to finish.\nFor a couple's stay, the amenities are a dream. We took full advantage of the spa, which offers couples' treatment rooms, and it was a wonderfully rejuvenating experience. The outdoor pool on the 10th floor, with its poolside bar and cabanas, provided a perfect spot to relax and enjoy the Mumbai skyline.\nDining was a culinary adventure. The hotel has a fantastic selection of restaurants, and the breakfast buffet at Seven Kitchens was a particular highlight. The spread is immense, offering everything from international favorites to local Indian delicacies, and the quality was superb. We also enjoyed the evening cocktail hours, which added an extra touch of sophistication to our evenings.\nIn conclusion, our stay at The St. Regis Mumbai was everything we had hoped for and more. The combination of stunning rooms, excellent location, and, most importantly, the unmatched service and hospitality makes it an ideal choice for a romantic retreat. It\u2019s a place that knows how to make you feel pampered and valued, creating memories that will last a lifetime. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",

The grandeur of the all\u2013Art Deco design is breathtaking\u2014timeless, sophisticated, and executed with precision in every detail. The caliber of the facilities is nothing short of extraordinary. From the rooms to the common spaces, every corner of the property exudes elegance and modern luxury. I simply could not be more positive about what this hotel has to offer.\n\nWhat truly sets the Fairmont Mumbai apart, however, is the service and the culinary experience. The hospitality was unmatched\u2014every interaction with the team felt warm, thoughtful, and refined. The staff were not only attentive, but intuitive, anticipating needs before they were even voiced. Their attention to detail and genuine commitment to guest satisfaction elevated the entire experience.\n\nEach of the hotel's venues is a destination in itself.

The rooms were beautifully maintained and offered the perfect balance of comfort and luxury.\n\nA special mention to Chef Patil ji, who greeted us every morning at breakfast with a warm smile and a spread of absolutely delicious food. His personal touch and attention to our preferences made every breakfast feel special and homely. It was such a delightful way to start the day!\n\nAnother big thank you to Pushpalata ji from the room service team, who took great care in keeping our room just the way we liked it. She was always polite, attentive, and ensured that every little detail was taken care of, which truly enhanced our comfort.\n\nWhat touched us the most was the way ITC Maratha made my husband's birthday extra special. We were pleasantly surprised with a beautifully arranged cake, a bouquet of fresh flowers, and a lovely fruit basket waiting in our room. It was such a thoughtful gesture and made the day truly memorable for both of us.\n\nThank you, ITC Maratha, for a stay filled with warmth, care, and thoughtful touches. We\u2019ll always remember this experience fondly and look forward to visiting again!",

The spread, freshness, and flavors were top-tier. A must-experience.\n\u2022\tCleanliness & Amenities: Rooms were spotless, beds comfortable, and all amenities including spa, sauna, and swimming pool were well-managed and relaxing.\n\u2022\tLocation: You really can\u2019t beat it \u2014 central, premium, and peaceful.\n\u2022\tSpecial Mention: Paaji (Doorman/Host): A true gem! Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That\u2019s the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.\n\n\u274c Where things fell flat:\n\u2022\tCustomer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival \u2014 but received no response, and none of the requests were honored.\n\u2022\tCheck-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch. It felt like we were just another room number to him \u2014 not the Leela standard at all.\n\u2022\tRoom Allocation: The main reason I booked Leela was for the view over the swimming pool, and it wasn\u2019t provided even after communicating it in advance.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Final Thoughts:\n\nThe property is absolutely worth experiencing \u2014 beautiful interiors, relaxing amenities, and standout hospitality by individuals like Paaji.\nBut the front desk team and guest communication need serious improvement if The Leela wants to continue being a name that stands for luxury.\n\nWill I return? Maybe \u2014 but I\u2019ll think twice, and only after ensuring better pre-arrival communication.",

Right from the entrance, he made us feel at home. He greeted us with a respectful Namaste, handled our luggage smoothly, and opened the doors with genuine warmth. That\u2019s the kind of welcome you expect from a luxury brand.\n\n\u274c Where things fell flat:\n\u2022\tCustomer Relations: I emailed my room preferences (pool view, specific requests) well before arrival \u2014 but received no response, and none of the requests were honored.\n\u2022\tCheck-In Experience: Disappointing. The receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, no smile, no welcome drink, no personal touch. It felt like we were just another room number to him \u2014 not the Leela standard at all.\n\u2022\tRoom Allocation: The main reason I booked Leela was for the view over the swimming pool, and it wasn\u2019t provided even after communicating it in advance.\n\n\u2696\ufe0f Final Thoughts:\n\nThe property is absolutely worth experiencing \u2014 beautiful interiors, relaxing amenities, and standout hospitality by individuals like Paaji.\nBut the front desk team and guest communication need serious improvement if The Leela wants to continue being a name that stands for luxury.\n\nWill I return? Maybe \u2014 but I\u2019ll think twice, and only after ensuring better pre-arrival communication.",

Westin really needs to fix the house keeping security gap, pre-arrival experience and chef glitches. Most of the folks try harder ( like Ms.Jasmina, head of Housekeeping/Rooms, lounge staff ,the female sous chef etc) to ensure a great experience while others like the front desk, the male sous chef etc doesn't give a damn bringing down the overall experience.\n\nMore details below -\n\nPre-arrival Experience: 1/5. No body called and checked on the arrival time, we wanted an airport pickup which didn't happen, nobody even picked the call at their hotel number given. No response to chat either and finally when I got a call back and while conversing with a staff , she abruptly cut the call. Not a typical Marriott experience to start with, disappointing\n\nArrival Experience: 5/5. After the disastrous pre-arrival experience, Ms.Jasmina stepped in and fixed the experience for us, with a quick call,  an upgrade and welcomed us with providing a small cake and helped us with the occasion celebration welcome as well.\n\nRooms: 4.5/5. Spacious, huge rooms which is rare in Mumbai. View is off the highways and walking space around the property. Very close to Oberoi Mall.\n\nPrivacy/Safety + Housekeeping : 3/5. We had a huge security incident involving housekeeping. Ms. Jasmina again stepped in, apologized, brought the issue to the attention of the relevant people and helped sorting it out. Other than that, requests were promptly attended to, cleanliness was maintained.\n\nFood : 4/5. We had dinner and breakfast. Dinner lacked continental and seafood. Apparently they had pasta which the team never informed us, which was surprising. The varieties were there at both time and the female sous chef was super friendly ensuring the concerns were addressed. During breakfast, they ensured we get French toast. The male sous chef ( I guess) was super rude and when I asked for koki , he said \" Go, talk to the server and place the order, not to me\" if so, he shouldn't hang around the food counter and ask what do people want. If he doesn't want to do what's asked, then he shouldn't ask. Bizarre behavior. During dinner, they struggled to manage the crowd. A huge container of uncooked chicken was kept in the open kitchen behind the food counters for a long time which wasn't a good health indicator.\n\nFew glitches needs to be addressed which is evident from the other reviews as well.",

The staff were consistently polite and provided top-notch hospitality throughout our stay.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the beautifully designed kids' area. The inclusion of the small rabbit enclosure, fish pond, and bird area was a unique and delightful touch that our children absolutely loved. It created a wonderful atmosphere for them.

After much follow up, I was given one room with king bed and had again to wait for another room for a while. Finally I got second room around 3.45 pm.I had plans to take rest and go for a swim in the pool, but because of the delayed check in, all my plans went for a toss. One of the rooms allotted had an uncleaned window therby obstructing the sea view for which I had specifically booked.\n\nNext day morning, for breakfast at 9.30 am, there were 15 people waiting in the line outside the restaurant. We were asked to go to the other restaurant below. I had asked for a table for 5 which was given with 5 chairs and  only 4 table mats. Had to again wait for sometime requesting them to put the mat and the cutlery. Most of the food items were not even warm. Taste was just so so. Had to wait for bowls for sambar.\n\nOverall, our high expectations of a great weekend at a reputed hotel was not satisfactory.",

The hotel has a peaceful surrounding, but it is a bit far from the main city.\n\nPositives:\n\u2714 Beautiful and clean rooms\n\u2714 Excellent staff service\n\u2714 Delicious food and breakfast\n\u2714 Natural environment",

            "text": "Beautiful Hotel at a lovely location. Enjoyed the weekend of Independence day.\nWe did the booking directly with Taj. They were so helpful from the start,, Rohit the Asst Manager took care of all our needs specially for my old parents who needed a room for specially abled.\nCheck in process was smooth and perfect. Jasmeet had contacted us before our check in and made lovely decorations for our celebration of 85th Birthday as well as for Anniversary. Jasmeet said she was our one point contact for all our needs but unfortunately after we checked in she hardly responded to our queries.\nWe had booked 4 rooms. We had 2 pool facing rooms as those are the only ones for the specially abled people and 2 Mangrove view rooms which have an excellent view. You must choose mangrove view. Prachi did a very smooth check in for all our rooms.\nThe rooms are large and the bathroom has all ammentites. The Bathroom is designed so well that has a bath tub and separate enclosure for Toilet and bathroom.\nThe Houskeeping staff was very prompt. Specially Harshali who always attended to our requirements and she cleaned the rooms perfectly. Was very impressive.\nThe in room dining attended to all our needs and services but the timeline for serving should be improved as we had to call many times.\nThe hotel had made lovely arrangements for Independence day celebrations. They had tea coffee and snacks in the lobby with classical dance and music. They even had sweet dish plate in our rooms.\nThe Breakfast at  Shamiana was superb. The spread was fabulous with so much variety for Veg and Non veg. There were so many options in live counter for dosas, eggs, pancakes, parathas, puris, french toast etc. Maybe one day would love to drive down just for breakfast.\nMaybe one improvement can be made is to have a small play area for kids which we missed.\nThe ground level also has banquet rooms and ballroom. This will be good for destination wedding or corporate events.\nAnother beautiful highlight we saw was the way the hotel security lowered the flag after sunset and completed the formality with respect. The true way to do it even when nobody is watching. Was very proud of Taj Trees",

The charm and elegance of this place are unmatched, and it's a destination I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a blend of luxury and comfort.\n\nFirstly, the rooftop area was an absolute delight. The panoramic views of the city and the sea were breathtaking, providing the perfect backdrop for some tranquil moments away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. It's a great spot to unwind and soak in the beauty of the surroundings.\n\nDining at Cecconi's, the restaurant downstairs, was another highlight of our stay. The cuisine was exquisite, offering a wide range of tantalizing dishes that were a feast for both the eyes and the palate. The ambiance of the restaurant added to the dining experience, making every meal there memorable.\n\nThe room service at Soho House deserves a special mention. Prompt, courteous, and always with a smile, the staff made sure our every need was catered to. This level of service truly made us feel pampered and special throughout our stay.\n\nAbove all, our room and its amenities were the epitome of comfort and luxury. Every detail was thoughtfully designed to provide an unparalleled experience. The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, and equipped with everything we could possibly need. The attention to detail in the amenities provided added a touch of elegance and convenience to our stay.\n\nIn conclusion, our stay at Soho House, Mumbai was nothing short of exceptional. It's a perfect mix of luxury, comfort, and excellent service. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Mumbai, especially for a special occasion like a babymoon. Soho House has truly set a benchmark in hospitality, and we look forward to returning in the future.",

Yet, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer luxury and attention to detail that this property delivers. From the moment you step into the hotel, you are transported into a world of elegance, where every aspect is meticulously designed to offer an unparalleled experience.\n\nThe check-in process was seamless, and the warmth of the staff was immediately evident. Manjali was incredibly welcoming, setting the perfect tone for our stay, while Atul went above and beyond by helping us weigh our bags in the room. It\u2019s rare to come across a team so dedicated to ensuring guests have a flawless experience. Every staff member we encountered was genuinely kind, professional, and proactive in their service.\n\nThe rooms redefine comfort and sophistication. Every detail, from the plush bedding to the high-end amenities, exudes opulence. The ambiance is serene, and the cleanliness is impeccable\u2014so much so that it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in India at all. The hotel is immaculately maintained, with a signature scent that enhances the overall sense of luxury.\n\nHaving stayed at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, I must admit that Fairmont has surpassed it in every possible way\u2014hospitality, comfort, service, and overall experience. My wife, who initially had no plans to return to India, was completely blown away by this hotel. Fairmont Mumbai has completely changed our perception of luxury hospitality in the country.\n\nWhat truly sets this property apart is the staff\u2019s unwavering commitment to guest satisfaction. When I expressed my gratitude for the exceptional service, they humbly encouraged me to share any concerns if I had them\u2014showing their dedication to continuous excellence. If hotels could be rated greater than five stars, Fairmont Mumbai would undoubtedly be on that list.\n\nFairmont Hotel Mumbai is nothing short of spectacular. If you\u2019re looking for a world-class experience that rivals the best hotels globally, this is the place to be. Every moment here is curated to perfection, making it an unforgettable stay.",

From the moment you enter, the architecture, interiors, and the sheer grandeur of the property make it clear that this is not just another 5-star hotel \u2013 it\u2019s a true luxury retreat right in the heart of Mumbai.\n\nLocation & Convenience\nOne of the biggest advantages is its proximity to the airport \u2013 it's literally a 5-minute drive from the international terminal, which is a game-changer if you're flying in or out at odd hours. Despite being so close to the airport, once you're inside, it's peaceful and quiet \u2013 a perfect blend of convenience and calm.\n\nRooms & Views\nThe rooms are spacious, elegantly designed, and thoughtfully equipped with everything a modern traveler could need. My room had a lovely view overlooking the landscaped pool and garden area (was under maintenance) The bed was supremely comfortable, linens were high-quality, and the bathroom (with its fab bathtub)\n\nDining Experience at The Merchants\nA special shoutout to Sutanuka, who helped us with our restaurant reservations at The Merchants. Her warmth, efficiency, and attention to detail made the entire dining experience feel personalized and memorable. The buffet spread at The Merchants was nothing short of spectacular \u2013 especially for vegetarians, which is often overlooked at luxury hotels. From Indian to Mediterranean and Asian cuisine, the variety was impressive. And the dessert station? A dream come true. Beautifully presented, and even better tasting \u2013 especially the mini pastries and the live ice cream counter!\n\nCoffee & Cakes at Madeleine De Proust\nAnother gem within the hotel is their patisserie and caf\u00e9, Madeleine De Proust. Here, Ambika, the manager, was absolutely delightful. She knew her menu inside out and recommended some fantastic options. The cakes are some of the best I\u2019ve had in Mumbai \u2013 light, moist, and not overly sweet. Their signature chocolate cake and the hazelnut \u00e9clair deserve a special mention. The coffee too \u2013 smooth, strong, and served just right.\n\nInteriors & Architecture:\nEvery corner of the Hotel has thoughtful and extremly inspiring forms of art. From paintings to sculptures. Beautifully designed Interiors makes the place warm, hospitable but exciting!\n\nOverall Experience\nThe service across the hotel was consistently warm and polished \u2013 the kind you expect from a Fairmont but rarely see executed so well in a newly launched property. Every staff member, from concierge to housekeeping, seemed genuinely invested in making guests feel welcome.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhether you're a business traveler needing to stay close to the airport, or someone just looking to enjoy a weekend of luxury and pampering in the city, Fairmont Mumbai Sahar is a phenomenal choice. It\u2019s rare to find a hotel that combines stunning design, exceptional service, and culinary brilliance under one roof \u2013 and this one does it seamlessly.\n\nAlready looking forward to my next stay.",
