The breakfast buffet was yummmm and the staff was very attentive. I chose a corner seat and i was hidden away pretty much, but they found me and kept checking in and got me whatever I needed promptly. I really enjoyed that. Dinner buffet was also nice. The veg options were more than the non veg options but it was all good. There could be some more salad varieties but I loved it regardless. The room service was timely as well. I got a basil pesto spaghetti which was so rich that I couldn't finish it in one go. And the brownies were just heavenly. 10/10 recommended.",

I was extremely stressed about the work I had to get done and I had been travelling for 9 hours, but the moment i finally got to the hotel it was such a breath of fresh air. For starters, the staff is so SO friendly, helpful and accommodating. I believe it was Atul and another gentleman whose name I unfortunately can't remember who greeted us at reception, and the check in process was quick.\n\nPlease keep in mind they have the European plug points, for which I hadnt come prepared. The staff was so incredibly kind that one of staff members went out of their way to accompany us to a shop that had this plug point at 7ish in the night. They didn't have to do that, and yet they did.\n\nOn check out day I was struggling to find a cab at 5.30 am. All the staff that was gathered there assured me and reassured me that they will make sure we find a cab. They even went to the extent of saying if we don't have a cab, one of the staff from the security team who has a tuk will take us to the airport \ud83e\udd79 I can't tell you what a kind staff this hotel has and how helpful they were.\n\nThey even sort out breakfast packs for you if you're unable to stay for breakfast which was the case for me on a few days. If flew twice to India and I chose Cocoon hotel without any doubt on my second trip as well because their customer service and hotel over all is FANTASTIC.\n\nThe rooms are almost like a suite, because you additionally have a kitchen and an attached sitting area with a balcony as well. The beds are incredibly comfortable!\n\nFew things they could improve on would be to have a wider variety of food for the buffet. Their food was more vegetarian based, and the number of dishes at the buffet was limited.\n\nTheir alacarte menu though is really good. I highly recommend their cold coffee and chicken biryani.\n\nOne day upon request they even sent  tomato soup from the dinner buffet up to my room, even though I had just eaten from the buffet lol.\n\nAlso the entire hotel is sparkling clean, which was truly refreshing to see.\n\nThey could have a better selection of shampoos and conditioners as toiletries, because on the bottle it said 'shampoo and conditioner'.\n\nOver all, I will confidently recommend this hotel to anyone any day. They made my stay in Pune one of the most restful trips given that I was in India for some stressful work. Their staff, the gentleman who carried our bags to the rooms, the security team, Atul, Arjun (if I got his name correctly) and the rest of the team at reception were nothing short of fantastic. I don't understand how there are negative reviews on this hotel, because their kindness, prifessionalism, service was amazing. I'm a very picky person that isn't generous with good reviews, unless it was really good; and this place was par excellence. Cocoon hotel Pune, your staff deserves a raise.",

The room decoration was done beautifully and right on time, and they maintained cleanliness throughout our stay with a friendly and professional attitude.\n\nLastly, a big thank you to Tejas from the F&B team, who ensured our in-room dining experience was seamless and prompt.

I shared my honest review online, only to be personally requested by Ms. Carol at the reception to remove it, with the assurance that pest control measures would be taken immediately and such issues would not happen again. Believing in their word and commitment to improvement, I took down the review in good faith.\n\nHowever, on my recent trip to Pune, I reached out to Ms. Carol again to rebook the same room, hoping to see improvements firsthand. To my surprise, I was met with a completely unprofessional and dismissive attitude. They showed no courtesy, no intention to address my concerns, and no willingness to even speak professionally. Clearly, once the review was gone, so was their accountability.\n\nThis kind of behavior is not only unethical but also speaks volumes about how little they value guest safety, trust, and basic human dignity. Adding to my concern, this property is associated with the same family involved in last year\u2019s tragic Porsche accident that resulted in the loss of innocent lives \u2014 a fact that adds an unsettling context to how little regard they seem to have for people\u2019s wellbeing, both within and outside their premises.\n\nI am writing this review again not out of frustration, but to warn future guests to think twice before trusting the \u201cpremium\u201d claims made by Recedency Club Pune. Cleanliness, professionalism, and guest care should never be compromised \u2014 especially not when you\u2019re charging five-star rates.",

My room was excellent, very clean & comfortable. The staff were outstanding, very helpful & polite .. & the food was very good. I am from the UK & found the standards & quality to be up there with the best 4* hotels anywhere in the world. I highly recommend St Laurn & will come back for sure.",

            "text": "Disappointing Stay \u2013 Not Worth the 5-Star Tag\n\nI stayed at E-Square The Fern, Pune with my wife and daughter from August 15 to 17, 2025, and unfortunately, the experience was far from what one would expect from a hotel claiming to be 5-star.\n\nHere are the key issues we faced:\n\nLimited Food Options: The breakfast and dinner buffet had very limited variety, especially for vegetarians. The dinner buffet felt overpriced considering the lack of options and quality.\nRemote Location: The hotel is located on the outskirts and is not well-known even among locals, making commuting and navigation inconvenient.\nSwimming Pool Not Functional: One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the swimming pool, which was non-operational during our stay. This was extremely disappointing, especially since I had promised my daughter a fun pool experience. I had to alter our plans last minute and spend extra money to take my family to a water park instead.\nPoor Housekeeping Service: Despite turning on the \u201cMake My Room\u201d sign before leaving, the room was not cleaned. I had to call housekeeping after returning. Additionally, the staff left an empty glass outside our room, saying it was from the restaurant and someone else would pick it up. It remained there until we checked out the next morning.\nOverall Verdict: With the kind of service and amenities provided, this hotel does not deserve a 5-star rating. At best, it should be rated 3 or 3.5 stars. I would not recommend it for families expecting a premium experience.",

Spread across a lush, beautifully designed 40-acre campus, the resort blends meditation, modern living, and nature seamlessly. The architecture is minimalist yet luxurious, with meditation halls, water bodies, Zen gardens, and serene pathways that create a deeply calming atmosphere.\n\nThe resort offers a structured daily schedule with over 10 types of meditations including Osho Dynamic Meditation, Kundalini, Nadabrahma, and the famous Evening Meeting. These active and passive methods are designed to help release stress and connect deeply with inner silence.\n\nFacilities like the Basho Spa, Olympic-sized swimming pool, gym, and vegetarian dining areas add to the overall wellness-focused lifestyle. The campus is clean, well-managed, and attracts visitors from around the world, creating a global, open-minded community.\n\nHowever, the resort does have strict entry protocols including HIV testing and required attire (maroon/white robes), and the costs can be relatively high.

I usually stay in proper 5-star hotels, but thought I\u2019d give this place a try since it proudly self-proclaims to be a \u201c5-star\u201d property. Big mistake. Should\u2019ve just listened to my instincts (and probably a few older reviews I skipped over).\n\nLet\u2019s start with the few positives:\n\u2022\tThe location is quite decent, peaceful and well-connected.\n\u2022\tThe greenery within the property is honestly refreshing. You do get the feel of being surrounded by nature \u2014 a nice touch in a concrete-heavy city.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the good stuff ends.\n\nNow, the reality check:\n\u2022\tTowels with a Personal Touch: The \u201cfresh\u201d towels came complete with bonus strands of hair \u2014 perhaps a little too personal for my liking. I guess hygiene isn\u2019t part of their definition of luxury. The washroom had mosquitoes and flies buzzing around like they paid for the room. And the rooms? A mysterious, musty smell that could rival an old storage closet. Pretty sure the bedsheets hadn\u2019t been changed \u2014 but hey, maybe that\u2019s part of the eco-friendly experience?\n\u2022\tGym or Haunted House?: Decided to check out their so-called fitness center \u2014 and what a treat! Dead cockroaches in the corners, glorious spider webs decorating the ceilings, and gym equipment that looked like it was on life support. Most machines creaked dangerously and felt like they might collapse if you dared to use them. Definitely not for the faint-hearted. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen abandoned buildings with better gym setups.\n\u2022\tFront Desk Hospitality at Its Peak: Mr. Ejaz at the front desk clearly thought he was running a royal palace. His tone, attitude, and dismissive responses were so elite, it almost felt like I was being told off for daring to ask for a copy of my bill. When I requested supporting documentation before signing anything, he looked at me as if I\u2019d insulted the king.\n\u2022\tCheckout Drama: The lobby was empty, but the staff acted like I was holding up the next 300 guests waiting to check in. They were politely shoving me out of the room, as if I was overstaying my welcome by breathing their air. Such a warm farewell, really brings a tear to your eye.\n\u2022\tSo-Called 5-Star Luxury: If cracked furniture, poor lighting, reused toiletries, weak WiFi, and a humming AC that sounds like a struggling generator are your idea of luxury \u2014 then yes, this is a 5-star experience. For the rest of us living in the real world, this place wouldn\u2019t even pass for a 3-star property.\n\nBottom line: Oakwood Residency is the kind of place that talks big but delivers disappointment. Save your money and your sanity. There are plenty of hotels that actually value guests instead of treating them like an inconvenience.",

From the moment I stepped into the elegant lobby, I was greeted by friendly and attentive staff who made me feel genuinely welcome.\n\nThe hotel's location is truly unbeatable, nestled right in the heart of the city with easy access to numerous attractions and transportation options. It was a delight to have Central Park just a stone's throw away, allowing me to take leisurely walks and soak in the serene ambiance of the park whenever I desired.\n\nThe room I stayed in was impeccably clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The comfortable bed provided me with a restful sleep after a long day of exploring the city. I particularly appreciated the attention to detail in the room's amenities, such as the high-quality toiletries and plush bathrobes that added a touch of luxury to my stay.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were equally impressive. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious choices to suit all tastes, and the attentive staff ensured I had everything I needed. The hotel's restaurant also provided a delectable culinary experience, with a diverse menu showcasing both local and international cuisine.\n\nOne aspect that truly stood out during my stay was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff.

From the moment I stepped into the elegant lobby, I was greeted by friendly and attentive staff who made me feel genuinely welcome.\n\nThe hotel's location is truly unbeatable, nestled right in the heart of the city with easy access to numerous attractions and transportation options. It was a delight to have Central Park just a stone's throw away, allowing me to take leisurely walks and soak in the serene ambiance of the park whenever I desired.\n\nThe room I stayed in was impeccably clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The comfortable bed provided me with a restful sleep after a long day of exploring the city. I particularly appreciated the attention to detail in the room's amenities, such as the high-quality toiletries and plush bathrobes that added a touch of luxury to my stay.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were equally impressive. The breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of delicious choices to suit all tastes, and the attentive staff ensured I had everything I needed. The hotel's restaurant also provided a delectable culinary experience, with a diverse menu showcasing both local and international cuisine.\n\nOne aspect that truly stood out during my stay was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. They were knowledgeable, courteous, and went above and beyond to make sure all my needs were met.

The hotel boasts a great location in the heart of the city, making it convenient for exploring nearby attractions, shopping, and dining. The rooms are spacious, well-maintained, and offer a good level of comfort. The staff was courteous and responsive, ensuring a smooth check-in and stay.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s dining options were impressive, with a variety of delicious dishes to choose from. The rooftop restaurant provided a great ambiance with a lovely view. The amenities, including the pool and fitness center, added to the overall experience.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that some parts of the hotel feel slightly dated and could benefit from minor renovations. However, this did not impact my overall experience much.\n\nOverall, Aurora Towers is a great choice for both business and leisure travelers, offering comfort, good service, and a prime location in Pune. Would definitely consider staying again!",

The staff was courteous and responsive, ensuring a smooth check-in and stay.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s dining options were impressive, with a variety of delicious dishes to choose from. The rooftop restaurant provided a great ambiance with a lovely view. The amenities, including the pool and fitness center, added to the overall experience.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that some parts of the hotel feel slightly dated and could benefit from minor renovations. However, this did not impact my overall experience much.\n\nOverall, Aurora Towers is a great choice for both business and leisure travelers, offering comfort, good service, and a prime location in Pune. Would definitely consider staying again!",

I must say that my experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I arrived until the time I left, I was impressed with the hotel's hospitality, facilities, and the overall quality of service.\n\nUpon check-in, I was warmly greeted by the friendly and professional staff at the reception. The check-in process was smooth and efficient, and I was quickly escorted to my room. The room itself was spacious, tastefully decorated, and impeccably clean. The comfortable bed ensured a restful night's sleep, and the amenities provided added to the overall convenience and comfort of my stay.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the morning breakfast at the hotel. The Pride Hotel Pune offers a wide variety of options to cater to different tastes and preferences. The breakfast buffet consisted of an extensive spread of both Indian and international dishes. From fresh fruits and pastries to hot and savory items, there was something for everyone. The quality of the food was excellent, and the attentive staff made sure that everything was replenished promptly.\n\nThe Pride Hotel's location is also worth noting. Situated in a convenient area of Pune, it offers easy access to various popular landmarks, shopping centers, and business districts. This made it convenient for me to explore the city during my short stay.\n\nOverall, my experience at The Pride Hotel Pune for a one-night stay and morning breakfast was outstanding. The hotel's commitment to providing top-notch service, combined with its well-appointed rooms and delicious breakfast offerings, made it a memorable stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Pune, whether it be for business or leisure, and I look forward to returning in the future.",

From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. Allow me to share some highlights from my stay.\n\nFirst and foremost, the hotel's location is superb. Situated in a prime location, it offers convenient access to the city's attractions, shopping centers, and restaurants. Whether you're a business traveler or a tourist, the hotel's central location is an ideal base for exploring the vibrant city.\n\nThe spaciousness and elegance of the Royal Orchid Golden Suite truly impressed me. The room I stayed in was beautifully decorated and well-appointed with modern amenities. The attention to detail in design and comfort was evident. The bed was luxuriously comfortable, providing me with a restful night's sleep after a long day of exploring. The suite also featured a separate living area, which was perfect for relaxing or catching up on work.\n\nThe impeccable service provided by the hotel staff deserves special mention. They went above and beyond to ensure my stay was as pleasant as possible. From the swift check-in process to the thoughtful recommendations for local dining options, the staff's professionalism and attentiveness were truly commendable. Any requests or inquiries I had were promptly addressed, creating a seamless and stress-free experience.\n\nThe hotel facilities were top-notch. The fitness center was well-equipped, allowing me to maintain my workout routine during my stay. Additionally, the rooftop pool offered a serene oasis amidst the bustling city. I enjoyed lounging by the poolside, soaking in the stunning views and sipping on refreshing cocktails from the poolside bar.\n\nLastly, the dining experience at the Royal Orchid Golden Suite was extraordinary. The breakfast buffet featured an extensive selection of both local and international cuisine, catering to all tastes. The quality and freshness of the food were exceptional, and the attentive service from the dining staff truly made each meal a memorable experience.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at the Royal Orchid Golden Suite was nothing short of exceptional. The staff's impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, convenient location, and remarkable dining options truly elevated my experience. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area. I'm already eagerly looking forward to my next visit to the Royal Orchid Golden Suite.",
